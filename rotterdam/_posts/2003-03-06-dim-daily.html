<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: order stir-fry and Chinese tea for lunch or an early dinner.</p>
<p>Dim Daily is a noodle bar that gets it right, managing to combine a good location, excellent food with fresh ingredients, good prices, reasonable speed and stylish decor. This isn't a place that does it for show - we have been to too many pretentious places with designer prices, rubbish food or both.</p>
<p>The best food is the fried noodle dishes, for which you choose from four kinds of noodles and one of ten or so ingredients. The bowls are big, the meat tender and the vegetables are fresh, crunchy and tasty. There is a similar selection of soups, more expensive rice-based meals and a large selection of starters, Dim Sum and sushi.</p>
<p>Peculiarity: free refils for the Chinese and Japanese tea</p>
