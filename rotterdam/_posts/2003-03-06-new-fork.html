<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Go for lunch.</p>
<p>New Fork makes the best of an ugly but convenient city-centre location next to City Lens with a bright and spacious sandwich bar, whose white tiles and pale wood are more like Lebkov by the station than anything else. The concept is similar: few staff, self-service, and fresh coffee, salads and sandwiches served in disposable packaging.</p>
<p>The menu and walls are sprinkled with the story of everything being suitably organic, biodegradable and natural, but that does not seem to stop them keeping the noisy hot-air blower on and the door open when the outside temperature is at freezing point. Either way, the sandwiches are pretty good, which is what counts.</p>
<p>When it first opened, New Fork was open at 07:30 for breakfast on weekdays, but now they open at 09:00. It is a shame that breakfast opening hours are not more popular in Rotterdam, because this place has the ideal menu for a healthy breakfast, with the likes of fruit juice, muesli and yoghurt.</p>
<p>As well as fairly normal tables and chairs, there are half a dozen armchairs to lounge in at the front. By the looks of things, the facade opens right up, so this could be a place to watch in the summer.</p>
