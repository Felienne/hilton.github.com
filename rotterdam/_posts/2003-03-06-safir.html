<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Tagine or cous-cous, for plenty of tasty food.</p>
<p>Safir is a well-deserved survivor on the not-quite-busy-enough Kop van Zuid. The friendly service and excellent food make this place well worth a visit.</p>
<p>On our visit, we sat in the light upstairs room with a big group. Downstairs, the intimately-lit brick-cellar area would be better for a smaller number of people or a date.</p>
