<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: try it out if you are in the area.</p>
<p>Hokkaido is an unlikely find: decent competition to <a href="dim-daily">Dim Daily</a> outside the town centre - a small Japanese/Chinese noodle bar, with pretty decent udon soup or stir-fry, as well as the obligatory sushi.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the atmosphere is half take-away, with a television on the wall.</p>
