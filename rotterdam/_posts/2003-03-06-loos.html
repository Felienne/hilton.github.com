<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: go for a working lunch.</p>
<p>Loos is one of the few places in Rotterdam with a <em>grand café</em> interior, but more formal and with less character than <a href="wester-paviljoen">Wester Paviljoen</a>, which reflects the part of town it is in - lots of suits on a week day lunch time, and more white wine than beer. As at WP, the lunch menu covers a broad range, from sandwiches and soups to burgers and pasta.</p>
<p>We tried the pasta of the week (€8.50), which was spinach and ricotta cannelloni, and the chicken and bacon club sandwich (€6.50); both were reasonable but nothing special.</p>
<p>There is also a more fancy restaurant section, which we have not tried.</p>
