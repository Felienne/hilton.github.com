<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: go for ice-cream and coffee.</p>
<p>Het Ijslokaal, a relatively new addition to this stretch of Nieuwe Binnenweg, is a small ice-cream cafe with a clean modern interior that provides a fresh contrast to the older cafes in the area. Coffee, ice-cream and service are all great, and the interior nice enough to make you want to hang around. The best spots are the stools by the window, and the small outside area at the back, for when it is hot and sunny.</p>
