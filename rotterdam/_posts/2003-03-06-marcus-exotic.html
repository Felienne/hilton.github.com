<p>Marcus Exotic is a cheap and colourful Surinamese restaurant where eating-in with your <em>broodje</em> is actually appealing, with a more relaxed summery atmosphere than Warung Mini. The prices are barely more than at a take-away, which makes for a cheap sit-down lunch.</p>
<p>The <em>Surinaamse broodjes</em> are good, as was the <em>Saoto</em> chicken soup I had. Portions are not big, though, so you may need to order a couple of dishes if you are really hungry.</p>
