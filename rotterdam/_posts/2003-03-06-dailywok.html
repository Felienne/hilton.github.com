<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: try take-away noodles when you have been to <a href="dim-daily">Dim Daily</a> too often.</p>
<p>Dailywok, opened in early 2005, is the best new fast food place to open in ages, serving rice and noodle dishes that are serious competition for <a href="dim-daily">Dim Daily</a>. The main reasons why this place is great are the low prices (€4-6.50 for main dishes and €1.50-2.50 for side dishes) and the fast, friendly service. No long waits to order or near-starvation before being served.</p>
<p>The food itself benefits greatly for being stir-fried while you wait - fresh vegetables and tender meat that is much better that the reheated stuff that some cheap places serve.  The decor is fresh too; its clean and bright modern style make this a nice place to eat in, if there is room - it is really small. Portions are smaller than at Dim Daily, but are still big enough to fill you up, and if you are really hungry the side dishes are pretty good.</p>
