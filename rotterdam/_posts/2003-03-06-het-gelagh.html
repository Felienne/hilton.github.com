<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: go for dinner, but not in a big group.</p>
<p>Het Gelagh is a fairly upmarket <em>eetcafe</em> style restaurant that serves an unusual selection of Dutch dishes with a Caribbean influence, or perhaps the other way around. The food is great, which along with the warm cosy interior makes this place worth a visit when you want something more fancy than Opa across the street, but with a similar atmosphere.</p>
<p>The main annoyance at Het Gelagh is that it is so cramped. It is fine for two, but on a previous visit with four people we had a table at the front that was not big enough, so there was no room to sit comfortably. The two tables at the very back are even worse. Our last visit was better, since the six of us had enough space, and we had a good experience because of the excellent service.</p>
<p>Peculiarity: you get <a href="http://www.cineramabios.nl/">Cinerama</a> cinema discount tickets with your bill.</p>
