<p>Good for: <strong>nothing</strong></p>
<p><strong>This Mexican restaurant just isn't good enough</strong> - go to Pssst Amigo if you want cheap Mexican food. Popocatepetl probably relies on its good location for popularity in the summer. I actually had to ask my colleagues to teach me a new Dutch phrase so that I could be sufficiently sarcastic to the waiter who made me wait a really long time for my second Margherita. The food was pretty good, but not as good` as Pssst Amigo, which has a much better atmosphere.</p>
<p>Before I became opinionated enough to refuse, I actually went back a second time because I was with a group who didn't know better. The service and food were actually worse that time, so now I wouldn't go near the place unless I'd had far too many beers in Cambrinus to be able to formulate a coherent objection (but that was another story altogether).</p>
<p>Peculiarity: being unusually mundane and having poor food and service.</p>
<p>Last visit: 2002</p>
