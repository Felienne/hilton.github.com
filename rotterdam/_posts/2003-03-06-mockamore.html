<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Go to Coffee Company instead.</p>
<p>Since Mockamore opened this second cafe, not far from its pokey little cousin on Beursplein, it has failed to impress.</p>
<p>The result does not look bad, perhaps only by Rotterdam standards, but the overall effect is immediately less convincing than Coffee Company. However, once you have spent any time here it becomes clear that the real problem is the terrible interior architecture. There is too much furniture and it does not fit well, the big awkward chairs being the main problem and not least because the bright red ones are jarringly ugly next to the green ones.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only reason to be here at all is that it seems to the only cafe in the area that stays open until 18:00 on Sundays.</p>
