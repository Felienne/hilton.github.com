<p>Although not quite as good as the very similar <a href="daily-wok">Daily Wok</a>, Wok To Go is a decent addition to the town centre's fast food places and a definite improvement on what went before. It provides simple Chinese stir-fry dishes with rice or noodles for â‚¬4-7. The food was okay, although sweet sauces feature on the menu too much for my taste, and the noodles were greasy-style.</p>
<p>It's a fairly close thing, but you're probably better off going to Daily Wok, which is a little cheaper and better, or <a href="dim-daily">Dim Daily</a>, which is a little dearer and a lot better.</p>
