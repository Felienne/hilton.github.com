<p>Good for: <strong>food - lots of it</strong></p>
<p>A fairly normal-looking Asian restaurant, this place does excellent food. Needless to say, the set menus are gargantuan, but there are a couple of good value menus for one. That is just as well if you cannot be bothered to try and decode the rest of the menu.</p>
<p>After having been to <a href="papaya">Papaya</a> so much since my first visit, we know what we like now, so on our last visit here we ordered single dishes from the menu and ended up with a much more reasonably sized and priced meal with excellent food.</p>
<p>Peculiarity: the spectacularly unimaginative name.</p>
