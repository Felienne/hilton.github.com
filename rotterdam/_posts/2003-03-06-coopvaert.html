<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Try the sun-trap terrace, or the fancy food and spacious interior.</p>
<p>Coopvaert is a new cafe in the big and open ground floor of the new tower block next to the Maritime Museum.</p>
<p>The interior is big, open and white, with well-spaced small tables and lots of warm wood. The bustle of the open kitchen, lots of flowers and cool music do well to stop the plece feeling empty. The terrace on Plein 1940 is also somewhat special, with the whole square and the maritime museum as backdrop, and sun all afternoon.</p>
<p>Our first visit was just a quick coffee, but the menu looked interesting enough for a more foody visit. Since it reopened, Coopvaert has new people and a new menu, but the same interior. This time around, it is more about the food, with a fancy <a href="http://www.coopvaert.com/menukaart.pdf">restaurant menu</a> (PDF) whose three three-course options (€32.50/€22.50) are almost the whole à la carte menu.</p>
<p>The limited selection of meals includes plenty of interesting options when we went for dinner, so we had all three menus between us. The carpaccio was great: a generous portion with plenty of rucuola, and tasty pesto and capers. The fish main course - sole - was also good, but less interesting, like the chocolate dessert: nice, but nothing special.</p>
<p>Coopvaert is defeinitely worth a try, especially if you like the decor, but ultimately the food needs to be better to compete at this price; for the same money, we prefer to eat at Soit and Zinc.</p>
<p>Peculiarity: the menu features the most bizarre spelling mistakes, which you might think were deliberate if that were not so tacky: 'genocchi', 'pannacota', 'fettecini', 'jakki torri', 'harricote verts', 'compotte', 'kommer', and even 'Coopveart'.</p>
