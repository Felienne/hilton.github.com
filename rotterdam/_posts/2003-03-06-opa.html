<p>Good for: <strong>drinks, dinner - kitchen open after 9 pm</strong></p>
<p>Although Opa seems to be just another <em>eetcafe</em>, I have eaten there more times than I can remember. This is probably because it is better than the competition in almost all the key areas: atmosphere, menu, service, location and value for money. Only the food is merely average.</p>
<p>Opa also scores well as a bar, with its lively party atmosphere at weekends, and the occasional opportunity to order caipirinhas.</p>
<p>Peculiarity: all the pictures of old men on the walls - geddit?</p>
