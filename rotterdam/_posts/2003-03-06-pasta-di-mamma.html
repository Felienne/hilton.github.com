<p>Pasta di Mamma, formerly known as Terra Ferma, is the Italian cafe-deli that serves the best sandwiches in Rotterdam. There is a choice of about 20 sandwiches on a choice of large freshly-baked rolls, with some delicious ingredients from the Italian deli. Our favourites are the Bari - parma ham, mozzarella and pesto - and the grilled aubergine one.</p>
<p>You order at the counter, which is unconventional, but the staff are friendly and efficient and there is no waiting ten minutes for you coffee. We think this is a good thing, if it means being able to go for lunch without it taking all day.</p>
<p>There is plenty of room to sit down, in a big open space with plenty of tables and daylight from double-height windows at the front. The decor is fairly plain, but stylish with it.</p>
<p>This place never seems to be particularly packed, perhaps because most people get take-away, and because there are few shops nearby. Or perhaps everyone just faxes in their orders for delivery (minimum order €20), which went down very well at the office when we did it. Too bad you cannot order by e-mail.</p>
