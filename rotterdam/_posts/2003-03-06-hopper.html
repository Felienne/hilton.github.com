<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: go for lunch, and stay all afternoon.</p>
<p>Hopper is something new in Rotterdam: a cafe that might just give <a href="urban-espresso-bar">UEB</a> and <a href="ueb-west">UEB West</a> a run for their money. Like the Urban Espresso Bars, Hopper also has the minimalist bare-wall decor and high ceilings that result in an uncluttered space and an easy-going atmosphere, combined with excellent coffee and and food.</p>
<p>It looks like Hopper is going to be directly competing with UEBâ€™s excellent sandwiches, coffee and cake. Not only does Hopper also serve a mean flat-white (a newly-trendy serious coffee); it raises the stakes by baking its own delicious crusty bread and offering a tantalising menu of sandwiches and snacks. Cookies and chocolate cake are one thing, but Hopper joins Paladar and Kip Gallery in serving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastel_de_nata">pasteis de nata</a>. There is even free WIFI and a big terrace.</p>
<p>On our first visit, we started what might be the simplest thing on the menu: a sour bread cheese and chorizo toasted sandwich, which turned out to be so good that we cannot wait to go back and try everything else: the other sandwiches on the menu certainly sound interesting, and the hummus sandwich is reportedly even better than the smoked salmon, which would be saying something.</p>
