<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: worth a try.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.bagelsbeans.nl/winkel_hoogstraat_rotterdam.shtml">Bagels &amp; Beans</a> has a great sunny location for its successful cafe chain concept, but in the past has occasionally suffered from not so much poor service as utterly useless staff. Fortunately, on recent visits, the staff have proved to be more effective than they look, making this a good place to pop in for lunch.</p>
<p>The menu features a wide variety of bagels and related lunch items that are fairly good, although many of the combinations are somewhat odd. The result is plenty of choice, but no single option that is excellent.</p>
