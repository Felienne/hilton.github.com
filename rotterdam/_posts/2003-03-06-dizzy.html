<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: go for drinks, stay for dinner, and check out the jazz evenings.</p>
<p>Dizzy is much better than the average eetcafe, with good food, an interesting menu, reasonable service and a great atmosphere. The menu is an imaginitive fusion affair, which is relatively rare in Rotterdam and makes a change from the usual nosh and the meat, veg or fish dish of the day is usually worth a look.</p>
<p>Dizzy is also a good place for lunch, with fantastic hot sandwiches, such as the Miles Davis stewed beef sandwich.</p>
<p>Best of all, though, is the atmosphere, which blends the liveliness of a popular and closely packed eetcafe with a more mellow jazz cafe feel that is much more evident on a quiet afternoon. Also, the garden out the back is a nice extra on a summer evening</p>
