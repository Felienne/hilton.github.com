<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: give it a try when you want a change from <a href="dim-daily">Dim Daily</a>.</p>
<p>Although Gamasot has been here for some time, we did not try it until after we started going to <a href="daily-wok">Daily Wok</a>, which encouraged us to try more <a href="dim-daily">Dim Daily</a> alternatives. Gamasot is a Korean cafe, so the food is also a little alternative if you are only used to Chinese food, but recognisable. We really enjoyed the stir-fried rice dish with an egg on top and miso soup on the side. The new thing for us was the <em>kimchi</em> - a kind of spicy cold cabbage side-dish, which we gather comes in many varieties.</p>
<p>The food is great, overall, and the service excellent. The prices are more or less the same as at Dim Daily, so Gamasot loses out only by having a less comforatble atmosphere - like a harshly-lit snack bar. On balance, this place is definitely worth a try, and we shall go back, but probably only for a change when we have been to Dim Daily too much (if such a thing is possible).</p>
