<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: worth a try for lunch or dinner.</p>
<p>Hoofdstuk II is a large traditional-style cafe with a bookish theme ('hoofdstuk' means 'chapter') and lots of books-as-decor amongst the wood panelling. The style of the place makes for a good ambiance, so this is a pleasant place for drinks or food.</p>
<p>The menu has the same kind of upmarket cafe prices as <a href="het-gelagh">Het Gelagh</a> - somewhere between average and posh - but with more conventional European dishes.</p>
<p>Weekday lunchtimes attract a large business crowd from the offices on Admiraliteitskade, and the lunch menu has a large selection of sandwiches and egg dishes for around €7. Top of the lunch menu is the €9.75 salmon club sandwich that we tried; it turned out to be very tasty with lots of smoked salmon, but not as good value as the more reasonably priced baguette or omelet options.</p>
<p>It has been a while since we tried dinner here; the food was good, and fairly sophisticated. There is also an above-average selection of beer on tap.</p>
