<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: go for lunch, and sit in the garden in the summer.</p>
<p>Floor is a cafe-brasserie with a modern style and a fairly chic atmosphere, with a fairly stylish interior and a smart, often trendy, crowd eating in pairs or drinking in groups. The last two times we went for lunch there was a scattering of people in suits, while evenings often include the theatre crowd and no empty tables at all. We prefer Floor when it is empty, with far better service and without the thick clouds of smoke.</p>
<p>The lunch menu is nicely varied, with basic sandwiches and some excellent more fancy ciabattas and the like. There are also hot dishes that we have not tried. Floor scores in the summer, when you can sit outside in the large garden behind the cafe. Surrounding buildings make this a sheltered sunny spot, and there is plenty of space to sit around and enjoy a long lunch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Floor occasionally ruins its advantages with appallingly bad service. On our last visit, the four of us were brought three wrong sandwiches, out of the four we ordered. The waiter then turned what may have been a simple mistake into a bad experience by trying to tell us that it was our fault and even started pointing at the menu.</p>
