<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: go to Locus Publicus for beer instead.</p>
<p>Good for: <strong>beer, drinking, beer, drinking beer</strong></p>
<p>This <i>Oude Haven</i> bar used to have an excellent selection of beers, with eight on draught, but now the place has gone seriously down hill - past glories mostly forgotten. The knowledgeable (ex-)student staff and the legendary beer menu are gone, leaving an empty shell of a pub that seems rather desolate these days.</p>
<p>They also serve cafe food, which I do not normally associate with a busy pub atmosphere. Cambrinus is certainly more popular than most of the other local bars, probably because its interior is better suited to the dark winter evenings.</p>
<p>Cambrinus is okay in the summer, when the bar moves to its terrace out the back in the corner of Oude Haven. Cambrinus’ terrace used to the others on account of its decent furniture and better selection of draught beers, but not any more - now its lack of early-evening sun make it second-choice.</p>
<p>Even the menu used to be better several years ago, but now the food really lacks the originality it used to have and the quality to justify its above-average prices: you can get a better €15 steak and chips elsewhere.</p>
