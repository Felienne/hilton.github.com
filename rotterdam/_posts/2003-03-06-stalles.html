<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: go for an evening's drinking, and then try lunch the next day.</p>
<p>Stalles is one of the more accessible small bars on Nieuwe Binneweg despite the grungy atmosphere, which survived the refurbishment. Unfortunately, the large single malt whisky selection and individual whisky lockers did not. Being small, there is not much room to sit down when it is busy - you are more likely to be standing at the bar unless you are there to indulge in some afternoon drinking.</p>
<p>Unexpectly, perhaps, this is a good place to eat. Sandwiches, decent pizzas and excellent lasagne are available from 1730 to 2100 (2200 Thursday - Saturday), with â‚¬5 pizzas on Mondays and Tuesdays.</p>
<p>Of course, Stalles remains best as a popular night-time bar that is less trendy than <a href="de-witte-aap">De Witte Aap</a> and less grungy than De Consul, finding a popular niche between the two.</p>
