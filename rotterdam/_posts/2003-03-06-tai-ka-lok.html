<p>Tai Ka Lok, formerly known as Yang Sweetie, is a no-frills Chinese small restaurant that looks like it has got its original 1960s decor and flourescent lights. Clean, busy and friendly, with thirty packed-in seats. The noodles were okay, but fast rather than freshly cooked. The menu unexpectedly included a lot of Surinamese dishes, but the veggie <em>roti</em> was not especially good.</p>
<p>What makes this place worth coming back to are the <em>Surinaamse broodjes</em> - the cha sieuw one is excellent.</p>
<p>This could be a good place for late-night food, though, because the kitchen is open until 0030, and 0130 at weekends.</p>
