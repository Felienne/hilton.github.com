<p>Good for: <strong>take-away sandwiches</strong></p>
<p><strong>These are the best sandwiches in town</strong> - Italian rolls with elaborate and tasty fillings. Each choice has several ingregients, with lots of herbs and oil, making it nothing like the more run-of-the-mill sandwiches you get elsewhere. There are also slices of pizza, which I've never tried.</p>
<p>Service can be slow, because the sandwiches take a while to assemble, and because the rolls get heated up first. I never seem to mind, because the (usually) all-Italian staff are friendly and cheerful.</p>
<p>Peculiarity: it's still worth queueing for a sandwich no matter how long you have to wait.</p>
