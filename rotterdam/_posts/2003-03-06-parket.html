<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: go for drinks and try the cocktails.</p>
<p>Parket used to be a nice seedy bar, so it was a surprise when its recent renovation turned it into a cool modern bar that rivals <a href="de-witte-aap">De Witte Aap</a>. Parket is a popular popular place, but there is usually still room to squeeze in at the bar to guzzle cocktails, even at midnight on a Friday. The caipirinhas and mojitos are rather good, as it happens.</p>
<p>As well as good cocktails, Parket has good furniture, with a sofa inside and plenty of seats on the terrace outside that takes over the pavement on weekend evenings.</p>
<p>Parket shares various things with <a href="stalles">Stalles</a> next door, such as owners the toilets at the back, but otherwise they are quite different bars. Probably market segmentation, or something.</p>
