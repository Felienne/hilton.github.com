<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: go for an excellent expensive dinner.</p>
<p>Good for: <strong>expensive and excellent Italian food</strong></p>
<p>Lux is a great place to go if you love Italian food and want to splash out on. It is one of the more expensive restaurants that we have been to in Rotterdam, being about twice as expensive as most eetcafes, but well worth a visit. The difference is in the menu's quality and originality, the service and the space you get to yourself.</p>
