<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: go for dinner when you fancy Indonesian food.</p>
<p>Restaurant Indonesia have come up with a good competitor to Dim Daily with their downstairs Indonesia Satebar. It is a stylish place with modern decor and a great atmosphere, which is a great improvement on the traditional and more boring retaurant upstairs.</p>
<p>The menu is a simplified version of the full menu upstairs, and is more oriented towards straightforward manageable dishes than the whole <em>rijsttafel</em> blow-out. The food, value and service, however, remain excellent. For example, the chicken sate with soy-sauce (â‚¬7) was tender and tasty, with a deliciously spicy sauce, and fresh salad.</p>
<p>Best of all, for the summer, is the air-conditioning - a rare luxury in Rotterdam.</p>
