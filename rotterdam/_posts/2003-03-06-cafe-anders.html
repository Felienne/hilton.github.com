<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Recommendation: move into the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Previously closed down, Café Anders reopened in August 2010.</p>
<p>Although it is difficult to pin down why, Café Anders is Rotterdam's best bar for locals. Its location North of the city centre gives it a local thirty-plus crowd, one or two of whom are permanent fixtures. The quiet atmosphere, mobile phone ban, and down-to-earth decor, including the wall tiles from the former butcher's, make this the ideal kind of bar to sit around and chat over a beer: <em>Korenwolf</em> on tap.</p>
<p>The interior is not very big, but as well as the space around the bar, there is a back room, a gallery upstairs, and a decent terrace in the summer. The gallery is the best place to sit, preferably next to the pulley that hoists a drinks tray up from the bar.</p>
