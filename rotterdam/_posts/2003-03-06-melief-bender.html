<p>Good for: <strong>drinks</strong></p>
<p>Melief-Bender is a very Dutch bar, where you almost feel obliged to sit at the bar with your mates and drink normal beer, rather than anything fancy. The atmosphere and crowd seem to vary a lot, but this bar has that certain something that makes sitting around for hours drinking beer and chatting seem the most normal thing in the world.</p>
<p>Shockingly, the layout changed at some point in 2004, with some of the tables removed to make more standing room, and new round standing tables added. This is no bad thing, as it was often cramped before.</p>
