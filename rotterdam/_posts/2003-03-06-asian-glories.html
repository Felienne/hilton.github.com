<p class="recommendation" itemprop="summary">Try the specials that you would not normally see on a Chinese menu.</p>
<p>Despite the tacky name, Asian Glories may well be the classiest Chinese restaurant in town. Although there are others that have excellent food, as well as more expensive restaurants like this one that have better service, Rotterdam's Chinese restaurants rarely combine this level of food and service with a menu that includes more modern interpretations of traditional dishes.</p>
