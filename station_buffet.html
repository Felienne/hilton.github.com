		<p>Through the glass doors I saw her pause,
		<br>And gather herself for an entrance.
		<br>No hint of a waddle, she paced like a model,
		<br>Which the lady had certainly been - once.
		
		<p>Five paces down, then pause and turn,
		<br>Like a barquentine expertly tacked.
		<br>Then pace on some more, turn and pace to the bar,
		<br>No-one else seemed to notice the act.
		
		<p>So pausing to think what to order to drink,
		<br>This fine middle-aged English rose,
		<br>And still quite a beauty, she just went off duty,
		<br>Took off a glove and picked her nose.
