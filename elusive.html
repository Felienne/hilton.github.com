<p>When I first toddled to the garden gate
<br>And saw the road was curved, I had to go,
<br>Spurred by an instinct, probably innate,
<br>To see what lay beyond. I had to know.</p>

<p>It always seems there’s something out of sight,
<br>Just round the corner, if I could see more.
<br>What causes déjà vu that guides me right
<br>In places I have never been before?</p>

<p>Are things elusive because I’m obtuse,
<br>Or is the Muse herself somewhat arcane?
<br>I wish I knew some magic to seduce
<br>And coax her to express herself in plain.</p>

<p>The waking dreams I cannot recall.
<br>The insight that could clarify it all.</p>
