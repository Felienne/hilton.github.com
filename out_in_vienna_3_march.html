	This South American restaurant could turn out to be the best 

	recommendation I get all week. The name is the wrong way around, though - I'm having some <em>ron</em> first while I wait for my <em>comida</em>.</p>



<p>	It's busy so I have to eat at the bar, from where I am admiring the 

	unfeasibly large rum collection. I can't be bothered to count them, but there are about 150 different bottles of rum, with spares for most of them. I wonder which one is contributing the my gorgeous cocktail.</p>



<p>	Just like cafe <em>Sul Palco</em> in Luxembourg, this bar-restaurant 

	looks as if it were a Habitat shop in a previous life: light pine everywhere and stylish everything, including most of the other customers.</p>



<p>	My food is a spicy vegetable and squid rice dish, with lots of lime. It

	is fantastic, and just the kind of thing that I try to cook myself. The guy I'm with has just told me about a friend of his who eats here most days, and has asked how much a monthly ticket for the restaurant would cost!</p>



<p>	(I had to come back, two days later, just to try the cocktails again.

	It's only 8.30 p.m. this time and much quieter, although I would rather sit at the bar, still, because it's a good bar. The <em>Caipirinha</em> is absolutely gorgeous, although a bit too sweet, unlike the <em>Caipirissima</em>, which is fantastic. I shall have to see if I can reproduce this in the safety of my own home.)</p>



<p>	Back again, another two days later, it's a quiet night again - probably

	because we're early. This time I had a beef dish because it is marked <em>sehr, sehr scharf</em> - very, very hot - on the menu, and I was curious to see what that means around here. On UK curry terms it turns out to be a good notch down from a madras, so I guess it would qualify as 'hot', but nothing else. Anyway, I think that my beef is just right, with spicy rice, beans and a couple of unidentifiable side dishes.</p>



<p>	The presentation has turned out to be much more poncy for the desert - 

	my dark chocolate mousse (gorgeous) is on a pointlessly big plate with non-random sprinkles of icing sugar, and a puddle of colourful but unidentified sauce. There is even a sprig on mint, which I hate. Anyway, that was another good meal here, and possibly not the last.</p>
