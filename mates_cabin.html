<!-- ======================================================================== -->

		<p>This little cabin's twenty-eight years old.
		<br>How many human stories does it hold?
		
		<p>How many young men trying to make their pitch
		<br>Have grafted hard and made the owners rich?
		<br>How many Masters well beyond the brink
		<br>Have passed this way dissolving in their drink?
		
		<p>Who washed, spewed, bled in that small basin there,
		<br>And winked in the glass brushing his hair,
		<br>Anticipating what may be in store
		<br>If luck is with him when he goes ashore.
		
		<p>How much of love have these old bulkheads seen,
		<br>And how much lust and all the grades between?
		<br>And who sat here before me at this table,
		<br>And wrote to slim Felicity, fat Mabel,
		<br>The tax man, the insurance and the wife,
		<br>And what were their ideas of the sea life?
		
		<p>My great great grandson, if he goes to sea,
		<br>Will know the same as Captain Noah, and me.
