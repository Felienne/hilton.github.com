The way I see it, this is what will happen...</p>


<h2>Image processing and expert systems collide</h2>

<p>It will happen by accident as it often happens when someone with two
seemingly unrelated interests has a new idea: the <strong>expert-systems</strong> researcher with a passion for the academic deconstruction of <strong>fine art</strong> makes a new connection.</p>

He is looking for an application for his <strong>image analysis</strong>
application - when he has the idea that can teach it his <strong>knowledge about art</strong>. Later, our researcher has developed a new application which generates <strong>natural language critiques</strong> of digital images of fine art.</p>


<h2>The technology is applied slightly differently</h2>

<p>One of our researcher's colleagues takes an interest. His hobby, 
however, is <strong>photography</strong> and he just happens to have an eye for a good photo. Automatic photography criticism is born.</p>


<h2>High-street developers' <em>helpful hints</em> are automated</h2>

<p>The technology finds its <strong>killer application</strong> in the 
high-street: the shop where your photographs are developed can now use to new system to automatically sort your efforts into</p>

unremarkable pictures</li>
<li>stupid mistakes, such as pictures largely obscured by the photographer's 
thumb, which require a sticker containing a mercilessly patronising 'helpful hint'</li>
<li>pictures that will end up on the staff notice board to provide
general amusement, titillation or blackmail material</li>
<li>holiday snaps that are so naff as to be hardly worth developing.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Digital cameras become ever more user-friendly</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, consumer digital cameras start to include <strong>new
features</strong>. The first will probably be a warning message when you try to take a picture which is going to be completely blank or just too dark. 
<a href="http://photo.net/philg/" title="Philip Greenspun's home page">Philip Greenspun</a> has had <a href="http://photo.net/philg/research/aesthetics.html" title="Formalizing Photographic Aesthetics"> a similiar idea to this</a>.</p>


<h2>The Critical Camera</h2>

The culmination of all this will inevitably be a consumer digital 
camera that is truly <strong>critical of the shots you take</strong>. This will go far beyond warning you about photographs which are not going to come out.</p>

<p>Your camera will actually lock up if you try to take <strong>tedious 
holiday pictures</strong> of people you cannot remember or of tourist attractions that everyone has seen thousands of pictures of before. There will be an <strong>audible alarm</strong> that sounds whenever you are about to take <strong>cheesy sunset pictures</strong> and the like. The camera will even power itself down if any <strong>celebrities</strong> are detected in the field of view.</p>
