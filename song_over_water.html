<!-- ======================================================================== -->

		<p>My voice is in, I get up for a song.
		<br>'Fathom the Bowl,' rolls fairly round the bar,
		<br>And leaks through cracks and keyholes, starts the long
		<br>And fading journey to the farthest star.
		
		<p>Some stop their talking in the noisy crush.
		<br>Some take no notice, no less than their right.
		<br>You can't expect a deep enraptured hush
		<br>Singing in this pub on a busy night.
		
		<p>But one man on his way out to the gents
		<br>Changes his mind and pauses to attend
		<br>And listen, though he has to cross his legs,
		<br>And rush out when my song comes to its end.
		
		<p>Can Pavarotti make a claim like this?
		<br>My voice is more compelling than a piss.
