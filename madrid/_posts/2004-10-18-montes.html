<p>This well-known old-fashioned small wine bar is an excellent place for a drink on a sunny afternoon. It is cheap too - two fairly large glasses of really good white wine with a tapa only cost €3. So far, this looks like a perfect place to waste away the whole afternoon, but then I have work to do so we did not hang around. Recommended.</p>
