<p>Not wanting to spend lots on dinner, we were surprised to find a €12 <em>menu del noche</em> at a respectable-looking restaurant. The food turned out to be reasonable for the money, but not great. The rice dish was a fairly good simplified paella, but the roast ham and fried potatoes was less interesting, and both were rather bland. The wine was okay though.</p>
<p>This is the place that most tested how happy I am in an obviously gay restaurant. I am fine with the colour scheme and I can cope with the cliché of the six guys at the next table being much better dressed than me, but I do not really want to think too much about there only being one toilet, nominally unisex, with the locks removed from both cubicle doors. Still, the semi-pornographic flyer for El Show that came with the bill was merely funny.</p>
<p>On balance, this is a popular place that I enjoyed, and it is probably worth going for the a la carte menu, which is probably better than the cheap menu. However, I would look for somewhere more rustic for decent cheap traditional food.</p>
