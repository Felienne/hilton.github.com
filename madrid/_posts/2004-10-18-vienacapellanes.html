<p>This smart and shiny cafe is not  bad for a morning coffee and croissant. The style is mid-market commercialised Viennese, with lots of their 'products' everywhere. With the bright lights, boring furniture and lack of originality or individuality there is no atmosphere to speak of, but then that matters less in the morning when all you need is to wake up a little more.</p>
