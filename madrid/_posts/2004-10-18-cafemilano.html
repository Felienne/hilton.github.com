<p>After having shied away from tourist prices for lunch on Plaza Santa Ana, we ended up just around the corner on this nice little square. We would have sat outside on the small terrace, but all the tables were in the sun, so instead we went inside and sat at the bar. Right in front of the tortilla. Obviously, I would not dream of eating big portions of tortilla for lunch every day, but since Mukund is vegetarian then it is either that or cheese sandwiches around here. I am glad I did, because it was just how I like it - wet in the middle and really salty. It might have even been better than Isabel's tortilla, but then that is fairly unlikely. However, Café Milano has beer on draught, so they win on points.</p>
