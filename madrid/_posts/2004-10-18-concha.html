<p>Tonight's plan is to eat at a nice restaurant, to make a change from the big lunches and tapas in the evening. The restaurant is not open yet, so we found this nearby wine bar to get in a first glass of Rioja. This place is fake-rustic with a pleasant kind of Mediterranean atmosphere and mellow Argentinean guitar music - rather romantic, in fact. The glass of wine is lovely, and the small tapas sophisticated. There is a whole menu of similarly interesting looking tapas, so this would be a good place to come back to.</p>
