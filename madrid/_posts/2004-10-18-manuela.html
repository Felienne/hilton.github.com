<p>This Parisian bistro-style bar seems somewhat incongruous on this street, among the alternative and modern bars, and their customers. Still, it is deservedly popular - a big bright place full of retro class, with plenty of room to sit down, and a chatty atmosphere. They even have a large collection of board games, which probably comes in handy if you and your friends start using the place as a second home. We were lucky on this visit, and despite there being a lot of us, we all got to take over several tables and sit down, although it was relatively early (10.30 p.m.); the last time I walked past around midnight it was packed.</p>
