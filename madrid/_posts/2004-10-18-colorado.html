<p>Colorado is a tiny Argentinian bar that flirts with tackiness, with its inflatable beer bottles and chili peppers hanging from the ceiling, but which retains enough kudos from its Argentinian beers, fabulous mojitos and caipirinhas, and decent Mexican tapas. Best of all, this far side of Plaza de España seems to be tourist-free, apart from me, of course.</p>
