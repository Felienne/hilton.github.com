<p>I just had to try this place, because it has a <a href="/why_sofas.html">big comfy sofa</a>. It turns out to be a low-key and modern Italian place, with a less polished look than most modern Italian-style cafes I have been to. As well as the billion points for the sofa, this place gets extra points for great Illy coffee and cool non-matching bistro chairs, but then lost lots of them for playing Tracy Chapman music, which I hate.</p>
