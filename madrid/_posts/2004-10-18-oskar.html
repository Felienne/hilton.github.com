<p>I tried this place because I thought that the US diner-style tables and vinyl benches that I had seen inside might be good for getting the books out and working in the afternoon, but it turned out to be hot and stuffy inside, so we sat outside instead. That was not the best idea either, because of the heavy traffic and building noise. That is enough to make this place worth avoiding; this is a problem with many terraces - it is best to stick to the ones on small traffic-free squares.</p>
