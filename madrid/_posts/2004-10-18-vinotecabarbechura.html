<p>This branch of what I think is a chain is one of the nicer terraces on Plaza Santa Ana, with thankfully substantial parasols that provide plenty of shade. I really enjoyed both the cured duck ham with hummus on toast, and the cod tortilla. There is a big wine list, of course, but unfortunately I did not have time to investigate fully.</p>
