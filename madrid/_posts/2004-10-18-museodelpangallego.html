<p>This entry is the odd one out really - it is a specialist bakery whose decent bread is nothing compared to the gorgeous thick-crusted <em>empanadas</em>. I also got some mature cheese and fancy chorizo for good measure. I went back several times to get more <em>empanada</em>, for rare occasions when I wanted to eat at home, and also the wholemeal bread, which is something that I had really been missing.</p>
