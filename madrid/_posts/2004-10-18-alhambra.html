<p>We ended up in here while in search of Franco's recommendation for mojitos; this might have been the one he was looking for but he was not sure, and they turned out not to have cocktails. No matter, because good-value rum and Cokes served by a friendly and chatty barman in a pleasant atmosphere among attractive old-fashioned decor were an excellent alternative. Definitely better than many other bars around here.</p>
