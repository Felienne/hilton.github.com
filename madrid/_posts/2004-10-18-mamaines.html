<p>Just about the only decent cafe around here open at this time on a Sunday, this is actually quite a good place. It has a pleasant atmosphere, with cool lighting and paintings, and comfortable furniture. Unsurprisingly, given the Chueca location, this is a gay cafe, but only in a fairly low-key way; the only uncomfortable thing is the ghastly pale-green daubed and reddish-purple walls.</p>
