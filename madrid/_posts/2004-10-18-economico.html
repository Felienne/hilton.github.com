<p>This street in Lapapiés is one long stretch of cool cafes with pavement terraces, in a relatively downtrodden part of the centre. We were only planning to sit at the bar somewhere and have some tortilla, but then we ended up sitting at a window table here ordering half of a set menu. Just as well, because we had walked around so much that I wanted an excuse to hang around over lunch for a while. Specifically, the excuse turned out to be the large carafe of refreshingly chilled red wine that came with my tasty sea bass.</p>
<p>We chose this place for the cool music and funky wooden and tiled interior. Best of all was a kind of bustle that made the place interesting, without being so busy that it was not relaxing any more. Also, unsurprisingly given the name, the menu was great value, although I am told that that dates back to the family who used to run the place and serve up meals for a couple of Euro.</p>
