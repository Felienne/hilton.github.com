<p> This is a rock bar with serious ambiance, and is lots of fun when packed out late at night. The crowd here makes a good contrast to who you find in the more modern places, but everywhere we have been to around here, nowhere seems to be exclusively anything. Or maybe we are the odd ones out here, and just did not notice. The music started well, but it was time to leave once it degenerated as far as Elvis. Worth a look, but it might not be what you are after.</p>
