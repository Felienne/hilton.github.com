<p>This dark small bar is another trendy place that opens late for the crowd who want a modern stylish atmosphere and loud music. The chocolate nibbles on the bar are a nice gimmick, but being short-changed on a round of drinks was not. The predominance of locals here is striking, presumably because this kind of bar is not very accessible to people not in the know - from outside you only get the name and a black entrance, but no clues about what kind of place it is. From my point of view, all large European cities have good modern bars like these, so even if I went to them at home I probably would not bother much when exploring a new city.</p>
