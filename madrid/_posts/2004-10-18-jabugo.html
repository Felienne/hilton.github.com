<p>Big place with no frills but great food, which we ordered by the plateload with our beers because there were lots of us. Favourites were <em>pimientos del Padr√≥n</em> and the <em>patatas ali-oli</em>. Amusingly, one of the proprietors gave Lolo a free beer because she liked the look of him. Most women do.</p>
