<p>This tiny cafe right next to Cafe Milano also benefits from a terrace on this small pleasant square. The English menu reflects the proximity to Plaza de Santa Ana, so we had to go further afield before things get more interesting; just a coffee here, before heading off to Lavapi√©s for a proper drink.</p>
