<p>I found <a href="http://www.restaurantecolby.com/">Colby</a> while on my way down Fuencarral, while having a look at the trendy clothes shops; I stopped by this self-styled 'urban restaurantÂ®' for a cold drink. The music is thumping, the staff pretty, the decor strikingly red and black and the clientele designer-clad. This is all very well, but my iced lemon drink tastes somewhat artificial and sweet, which does not bode well for the rest of the menu - form over content, I suppose, or rather branding over character. No surprise, then, that the menu proudly suggests asking after their <em>merchaindising</em> (sic) <em>colby</em>.</p>
