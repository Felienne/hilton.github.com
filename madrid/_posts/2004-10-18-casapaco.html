<p>Having failed to find Taberna de los 100 Vinos on Calle del Nuncio, we ended in here for a glass of wine or two, despite it being just inside the tourist zone. The bar is attractively tiled and decorated with bullfighting memorabilia, but is more spartan than cosy.</p>
<p>We drank the smallest glasses of wine I have ever seen - narrow beakers that held about 5 cl, but these were refilled in a flash following a mere nod to the barman. We also ordered cheese and 'some ham', which turned out to be a plate of expensive <em>jam√≥n iberico</em> that was a bit over the top - that will teach me to be a stupid tourist.</p>
