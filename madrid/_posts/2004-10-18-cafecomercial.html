<p>Grand old-world cafe that is all marble, glass, floor tiles and brass. Not exactly cosy, but a good place to cool off on a hot summer afternoon. I would not rate the terrace outside because of the traffic, but sitting at the bar is nice enough. Sitting around chatting in the big lounge area is probably better.</p>
