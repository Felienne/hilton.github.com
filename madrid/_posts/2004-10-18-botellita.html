<p><a href="http://www.labotellitamadrid.com/">La Botellita</a> is a popular bar in smart part of town: it started loud, busy and trendy at 2 a.m.; then got louder and busier before the music went from modern, via the nineties, back to the likes of The Bangles. Weird, but fun. Still, late night bars with bouncers (called a 'club' in the UK) are not really my thing so left 'early' at 4 a.m. The gimmick: behind the bar, the spirits are all in little individual bottles - geddit!</p>
