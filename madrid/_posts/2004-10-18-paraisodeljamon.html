<p>Having been in here to buy bread and ham, I was curious to try out this bar-shop for a beer at the start of the evening. The bar experience has the same stark feel as Palacio del Jamón down the road, but there is a stronger meat smell here, which is occasionally distracting. The bar itself is a good place to hang around, though, because there is plenty to look at, not least of all the food; this is a good place to build up an appetite. The beer was not only nice, but nice and cheap at €1, and the <em>salchichon</em> and cheese tapa that came with it was good too. I would come back here again for an early evening drink, although not with a vegetarian, but I would not plan to hang around for an exciting night.</p>
