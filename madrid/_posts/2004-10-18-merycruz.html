<p>Although certainly not unique, this small canteen bar is a good place for a cheap lunch, and the <em>calamares</em> and <em>tortilla</em> were both filling and good. The television and smoking at the cheap veneer bar clearly go with the territory, but are bearable.</p>
<p>This is all good, because despite my current status, I cannot stand being around weekend tourists when I am trying to settle into a place and work out what the locals do.</p>
