<p>Good rustic bar that serves hearty Spanish food from a counter that is hard to reach when the place is busy. Most of the dishes are simple fare that is probably better combined with drinks and a few friends than eaten for lunch. The house speciality seems to be a <em>rosca</em> with is a giant bagel-shaped toasted bread roll with meat or cheese.</p>
<p>We found some substantial food down Calle Almendro at number 13, and with four of us were able to get more stuck into the menu than I could before. A cheese <em>rosca</em> satisfied Marion's veggie needs, and only the <em>huevos rotos</em> that Mar√≠a recommended were less healthy - lumps of ham and fried eggs on a pile of large thin oval slices of fried potato. Gorgeous stuff, and a pleasant place to eat once we were lucky enough to get a table and seats. However, the absence of red wine was bizarre and annoying, and the food is not particularly cheap, although it certainly fills you up. Good, and well worth a visit, but not quite a favourite.</p>
