<p>First I came here for the passable fixed-price lunch menu on a nice small square that is only marred by the heavy traffic (jam) along this narrow street and the exceptionally irritating talentless buskers. Not bad for around here, but it is probably worth heading further afield - i.e. out of the tourist zone.</p>
<p>On another evening we looking for somewhere for a first drink and nibble near Opera, and made a bad choice by coming here to try the inside. Crisps are not tapas, or at least not worth eating, and the rest of the food did not look that great. The atmosphere was boring as well, and there were no other redeeming features to keep us after we finished our beers. Not recommended.</p>
