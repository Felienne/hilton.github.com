<p>This is one of the nicer terraces in La Latina, but is inevitably a bit touristy. This is mainly annoying because it attracts people hassling you for money, one way or another. We ate straight-forward good-value Spanish food and appreciated the excellent service so much that the waiter had to come back and ask us if we were really sure about a €5 tip on a €41 bill - other than loose change, tipping is less common around here.</p>
