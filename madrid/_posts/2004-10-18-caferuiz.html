<p>This cafe was a good find, this time courtesy of Time Out Madrid, and may be an even better find than Café del Real, which I found a day before. Café Ruíz has the same dark-painted woodwork and smokestain-colour walls, but is more classy, with plants and big mirrors. It has the same bistro chairs and marble-topped bistro tables, but more comfortable bench seats, which Time Out frustratingly misnamed as sofas.</p>
<p>Although Café del Real has mojitos, which I do not like, the menu here says '<em>Caipirinhas - especialidad de la casa</em>', which is more temptation than I could possibly defend myself against. And it was good.</p>
<p>The big downside is the lack of air conditioning, but then there is that home-made ice-cream on the menu too...</p>
