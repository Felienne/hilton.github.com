<p>As a visitor to Spain, the nicest things to eat in a bar are the traditional simple tapas. However, Isabel explained that that is somewhat boring for locals, who have that kind of thing at home anyway. That is why more upmarket bars like this one have fancier kinds of tapas. The food was indeed impressively original and tasty, being to traditional tapas what Jamie Oliver's recipes are to traditional English cuisine. For the rest, this is a lively popular bar that made for a good evening.</p>
