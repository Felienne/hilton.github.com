<p>Small minded self important worm,
<br>My curse on you this day.
<br>If you could see yourself you'd squirm,
<br>And shrivel clean away.

<p>A public servant, you refuse
<br>The service we expect,
<br>And anyone who might accuse,
<br>You scornfully reject.

<p>A yapping dog behind a gate,
<br>You use the Regulations
<br>To shield yourself from your just fate,
<br>A coward's tribulations.

<p>If you have wed a cross grained wife
<br>Who will not toast your bread,
<br>I wish you seven times the strife,
<br>And biscuit crumbs in bed.

<p>And may she snore throughout the night,
<br>And scream at you all day,
<br>And you, despairing in your plight,
<br>Afraid to run away.

<p>Your children, or at least your wife's,
<br>Will treat you to their sneers.
<br>Your spirit is so mean that life's
<br>Pleasures bring only tears.

<p>We all know what you're trying to do.
<br>They call it self assertion,
<br>But what inadequacies brew
<br>This paranoid perversion?

<p>I will not remain detached and cool.
<br>I need not take the trouble
<br>To curse you when, poor silly fool,
<br>You curse yourself, and double.
