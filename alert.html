<p>The wind screams down the cloud torn skies.
<br>It blows a raging gale.
<br>The hailstones make you close your eyes.
<br>It's wisest not to sail,
<br>But one boat dare remain out there.
<br>Her crew don't think it hard.
<br>The safety boat; her constant care
<br>To keep a watchful guard.

<p>I've heard men say it can be dull,
<br>But that's not really true.
<br>The world of dolphin, tern and gull
<br>Brings plenty work to do.
<br>Though vigilance when gales are laid
<br>May sound a piece of cake.
<br>To stay sharp as a razor blade
<br>Needs practice... no mistake.

<p>And day by day, whatever goes,
<br>You keep your careful notes.
<br>You practise with your radios
<br>And exercise your boats.
<br>Fast rescue boats need crews who will
<br>Get launched with lightning speed,
<br>For hypothermia can kill
<br>In minutes... all take heed.

<p>For fire float, lifeboat, ambulance,
<br>At once you're all of these.
<br>You never must be caught with pants
<br>Descending round your knees.
<br>The rig crews need to know you're there,
<br>And wide awake each second.
<br>Next hour, next day, next week, next year,
<br>You will be there when beckoned.

<p>And even when you rescue men.
<br>They may be close to death.
<br>Your crew and paramedics then
<br>Can help them still draw breath.
<br>You have accommodation fit
<br>To see them through the storm,
<br>And medicines and first aid kit
<br>To keep them safe and warm.

<p>The men who so depend on you
<br>May give it little thought,
<br>Or some may think high praise your due,
<br>According as they're taught.
<br>So keep your training up to date,
<br>Be proud of what you do,
<br>Though some appreciate too late
<br>The safety boat and crew.
