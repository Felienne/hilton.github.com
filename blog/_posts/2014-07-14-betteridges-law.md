[Betteridge’s law of headlines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines) tells us how to interpret headlines that ask a question:

> Any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word _no_.

This tends to indicate sloppy journalism and happens to overlap with the tacky clickbait headlines that [@SavedYouAClick](https://twitter.com/SavedYouAClick) tackles, so we can use this data to test the so-called law.

To test the effectiveness of Betteridge’s Law, I used [All my tweets](http://www.allmytweets.net/) to load 307 tweets by @SavedYouAClick from 6 May - 30 Jun 2014. After filtering the list, I was left with 33 yes/no question headlines, with following breakdown of answers:

![8 (24%) yes, 7 (21%) maybe, 18 (55%) no](betteridge-breakdown.png)

**8 (24%) yes, 7 (21%) maybe, 18 (55%) no**

As far as Betteridge’s Law is concerned, we can consider a ‘maybe’ to be equivalent to a ‘no’, as it is also a failure to affirm the claim that the headline weakly hinted at. These results therefore contradict Betteridge’s supposed law in 24% of cases.

Meanwhile, informal analysis of the tweets by [@BetteridgesLaw](https://twitter.com/betteridgeslaw) reveals a collection of headlines where the answer is ‘no’ in all cases. This may, however, be due to prior selection.

In conclusion, and as Betteridge’s Law predicts, the answer to the question _Does @SavedYouAClick prove Betteridge’s Law?_ is ‘no’, in this case. But it _is_ right most of the time.
