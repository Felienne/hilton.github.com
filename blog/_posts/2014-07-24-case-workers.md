I had a bad experience at a cafe in the City of London yesterday: I ordered a coffee at the counter, the waitress said that she’d ‘bring it over’, but then it never came. After 15-20 minutes of coffee denial trauma I asked about my coffee, and the same second and third steps were repeated: she said she’d ‘bring it over’, it never came. On a more positive note, their process went wrong in an interesting way.

As the diagram shows, the process doesn’t seem to be that complicated. First I ordered and paid for the coffee, and the person who served me took my name. As far as I could tell, the idea was that someone would then make the coffee and someone else would bring it to me.

There were indeed several staff who seemed to share the work of taking orders, making coffee and taking coffee to tables (just not mine). Unfortunately, the one who distributed my coffee gave it to the wrong customer, who presumably neglected to consider that they hadn’t ordered it. Asking for a status update didn’t help, and only when I later cancelled the process and asked for my money back did they work out what had happened.

## Case workers

While I was waiting for coffee, I just happened to be reading about case workers in the book [Business Process Management - A Rigorous Approach](http://shop.bcs.org/display.asp?K=9781902505602) (really!). The author describes how even simple processes can run into problems when people working in different roles work on on different parts in the process, just as I was experiencing at the time. He writes:

> Many traditional production line industries have, for many reasons including motivation, moved away from the bucket chain approach and introduced ‘case workers’ who take responsibility for the entire handling of a case

Ironically, this approach is nothing new in cafes. The coffee misdirection I experienced would not have happened in an old-school Parisian café, such as [La Palette](http://www.cafelapaletteparis.com) (photo, above), because the waiter who takes your order also brings it to your table, and is far less likely to give the coffee to someone else. Possibly by the simple expedient of remembering what you look like.

When cafe staff take end-to-end responsibility for a set of tables, service is better. I dread to think that so many cafes (outside France) might be separating different tasks in the name of some kind of efficiency. After all, having someone collecting glasses who won’t take your order is the same annoyance as the number one complaint in the _Business Process Management_ book’s case study of a large organisation’s infrastructure services help desk:

> When I make a service call, don’t bounce me from person to person

If you’re thinking about enterprise business process management at this point, then you’re probably dealing with processes that are complex than getting me a coffee. These processes are no less likely to benefit from a case-worker approach.

If you squint a little, the first instruction of the artwork [How to Work Better](http://blog.idonethis.com/empty-work-quotes/) (‘do one thing at a time’) is about case management, and good advice for people working in both cafes and large organisations. So is number 10 - ‘Smile’.
