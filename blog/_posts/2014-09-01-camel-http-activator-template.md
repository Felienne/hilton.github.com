[Camel message processing using the Scala DSL](http://typesafe.com/activator/template/camel-http) is a new [Typesafe Activator](https://typesafe.com/activator) template - a tutorial that demonstrates the technique described in [Camel HTTP file upload with multipart/form-data](camel-multipart-form-data).

The goal of the tutorial is to show the minimal code to define and run a Camel route that uses the Scala DSL and standard Camel components. This demonstrates how little code and configuration is required to start using Camel with Scala.
