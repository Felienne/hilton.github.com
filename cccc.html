	Daily Telegraph crossword clues often contain words which stand for one or two letters, rather than a word. I found that this made the crosswords rather hard until I started recognising some of the more <strong>common abbreviations</strong>,	which I have listed below.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that these lists will be of much help in solving cryptic
crosswords other than the Daily Telegraph's. For a comprehensive explanation
of cryptic crosswords in general, including hints on solving them, consult
the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for rec.puzzles.crosswords</p>

<h2>other tips</h2>

<h3>anagram alerters!</h3>

<p><a href='picture/photo/germany/berlin_tacheles.jpeg'><img src='picture/photo/germany/berlin_tacheles_s.jpeg' width='169' height='125'   style='float:right'></a>
	A typical Telegraph crossword seems to contain about half a dozen 
	anagram clues. In this type of clue there will be a word or phrase which indicates that the adjacent word or words form an anagram of the solution.</p>

<p>A fairly common example of an anagram indicator word is <B>perhaps</B>.
So that you get the idea, some more examples are <B>organised</B>, <B>restored</B>,
<B>change</B>, <B>dire</B>, <B>prepared</B>, <B>disastrously</B>, <B>wrongly</B>,
<B>translation</B>.</p>


<h3>pull-out pointers</h3>

<p>The most commonly used word indicating that the solution is a straight
pull-out from the clue is <B>in</B>. Other possibilities include <B>from</B>,
<B>some of</B>, <B>held</B>, <B>a little</B>: for example, 

<ul>
	<li>'Someo<B>near</B>rested <B>held</B> close (4)' is 'near'.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>foreign words</h3>

<p>Foreign words, usually indicated by the name of the language, crop up often
enough to merit a mention. For example,

<ul>
	<li>'the Spanish' is EL</li>
	
	<li>'Regrets the ways of the French (4)' is 'rues' (c.f. 'way' above).</li>	
</ul>
