	Daily Telegraph crossword clues often contain words which stand for one or two letters, rather than a word. I found that this made the crosswords rather hard until I started recognising some of the more <strong>common abbreviations</strong>,	which I have listed below.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that these lists will be of much help in solving cryptic
crosswords other than the Daily Telegraph's. For a comprehensive explanation
of cryptic crosswords in general, including hints on solving them, consult
the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for rec.puzzles.crosswords</p>

<h3>anagram alerters!</h3>

	A typical Telegraph crossword seems to contain about half a dozen 
	anagram clues. In this type of clue there will be a word or phrase which indicates that the adjacent word or words form an anagram of the solution.</p>

<p>A fairly common example of an anagram indicator word is <strong>perhaps</strong> .
So that you get the idea, some more examples are <strong>organised</strong>, <strong>restored</strong>,
<strong>change</strong>, <strong>dire</strong>, <strong>prepared</strong>, <strong>disastrously</strong>, <strong>wrongly</strong>,
<strong>translation</strong> .</p>


<h3>pull-out pointers</h3>

<p>The most commonly used word indicating that the solution is a straight
pull-out from the clue is <strong>in</strong> . Other possibilities include <strong>from</strong>,
<strong>some of</strong>, <strong>held</strong>, <strong>a little</strong> : for example, 

<ul>
	<li>'Someo<strong>near</strong> rested <strong>held</strong>  close (4)' is 'near'.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>foreign words</h3>

<p>Foreign words, usually indicated by the name of the language, crop up often
enough to merit a mention. For example,

<ul>
	<li>'the Spanish' is EL</li>
	
	<li>'Regrets the ways of the French (4)' is 'rues' (c.f. 'way' above).</li>	
</ul>
