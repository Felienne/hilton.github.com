<p>This page is devoted the my <STRONG>shockingly simple</STRONG> way of knocking up a <STRONG>quick 
meal</STRONG>. Food snobs should read no further - go and bake something delicate 
that has a French name instead.</P>


<h2>Method</h2>

<P>Just follow these <STRONG>simple instructions</STRONG>, which apply to all of the recipes.</P>

<p><ol>

<div align="center">
	<img src="picture/illustration/pan.gif" align="right" alt="(illustration)" 
		  width=271 height=62>
</div>

<li>Collect your scales, measuring spoons and other precision culinary instruments.</li>

<li>Throw them all away.</li>

<li>Get a big <STRONG>chopping board</STRONG> and a <STRONG>Very Big Cooks Knife</STRONG>.</li>

<li>Put a big frying pan or <STRONG>wok</STRONG>, according to taste, onto the hob. 
(Remember to turn the hob on.)</li>

<li>Gather the contents of Pile 1 and chop anything big into <STRONG>smallish bits</STRONG>.</li>

<li>Put the pile into the <STRONG>frying pan</STRONG>.</li>

<li>Do that <STRONG>spatula</STRONG> thing for a while.</li>

<li>Repeat steps 5 to 7 for Pile 2 and Pile 3.</li>

<li>Don't forget to <STRONG>eat the food</STRONG></li>

</ol>

<h2>Madness</h2>

<STRONG>Here are the recipes,</STRONG> that is the contents of the three piles for each dish. 

<p>
Note: any nationality in a title should be preceded with 'Vaguely' and followed
by '-Style' so that 'Spanish Chicken', say, is really 'Vaguely Spanish-Style Chicken'.


<h3><font color="#666633">
Fish Finger Salad</font></h3>

<p>
<ol>
<li>olive oil, green pepper, iceberg lettuce, spring onions, mushrooms, 
salt, lime juice, a small amount of diced fresh red chili</li>
<li>watercress (or similar)</li>
<li>fish fingers, grilled until very crispy and cut into square quarters</li>
</ol>

<p>
Don't fry this one in a frying pan, because it's a salad. Try serving it with boiled rice or small new potatoes.
Note: the lime juice should be fresh and the fish fingers hot.


<p>
<h3><font color="#666633">
Chinese Fried Rice</font></h3>

<p>
<ol>
<li>vegetable or sesame oil, one egg, (spring) onions</li>

<li>peas, sweetcorn, prawns, chicken, ham, <ACRONYM title="monosodium glutamate">MSG</ACRONYM> (optional)</li>

<li>cooked rice (better done the day before and left in a bowl in the
fridge overnight)</li>
</ol>

<p>
All of the ingredients are optional, except for the rice. If you use the 
egg, scramble it on a high heat until it sets and breaks up into lots of 
little bits before adding the spring onions.


<p>
<h3><font color="#666633">
Pasta &amp; Tomatoes With Prawns</font></h3>

<p>
<ol>
<li>olive oil, garlic, salt, onions, green chillies, green peppers</li>

<li>black pepper, basil, oregano, prawns, tinned chopped tomatoes</li>

<li>cooked pasta tubes (that's English for <i>penne</i>)</li>

Rachel Alexander invented this one, although she claims to have nicked the idea from 
Browns.


<p>
<h3><font color="#666633">
Spanish Chicken</font></h3>

Serve with plain rice.

<li>red peppers, beansprouts, <ACRONYM title="monosodium glutamate">MSG</ACRONYM> (optional)</li>

<li>chopped tomatoes</li>

<li>cabbage, carrot, red or green peppers, <ACRONYM title="monosodium glutamate">MSG</ACRONYM> (optional)</li>

A big wok on a big gas flame is best for this one. The contents of Pile 2 
should be sliced into thin strips three or four centimetres long.
