	<p>I was never an expert on women, though I grant you I've known quite a few
	<BR>And if I knew everything, and told it all, it wouldn't be helpful to you.
	<BR>You may listen to all the great sages, and read every book on the shelf
	<BR>But whenever the subject is 'Woman' you have to find out for yourself.</P>
	
	<P>So although it can't possibly help you, I'll tell you some things I have found.
	<BR>Some women seem sweet, but are ugly inside, and some are the other way round.
	<BR>Some women are eager to take you, and make of you what you are not,
	<BR>And others will take you the way that you are,	for every last thing that you've got.</P>
	
	<P>One treated me with fairness, though I was sorely smitten,
	<BR>And one who came from Belfast was as simple as a kitten,
	<BR>But soon turned out to be the sort the simple life depresses,
	<BR>Except when frequently supplied with trendy clothes and dresses.</P>
	
	<P>And there were South Americans, Uruguyans, Argentines,
	<BR>But I was young and they were mostly useful sex machines.
	<BR>But now and then I'd get a hint of what I might have missed
	<BR>When matching smiles on parting showed a memory would persist.</P>
	
	<P>An older one was passionate, but sparing with reproaches.
	<BR>One was a jolly lass from Goole with breasts like motor coaches.
	<BR>She'd clean and polish, wash my clothes, and also do the cooking,
	<BR>And show her breasts to anyone who happened to be looking.</P>
	
	<P>But I've told you enough of my memories, I see some inquisitive glints,
	<BR>And I never name names as a matter of course, but I mustn't give too many hints,
	<BR>For none of these things is exclusively mine and I wouldn't have anyone hurt,
	<BR>And what I perceive as sweet tunes of old times will be seen by another as dirt.</P>
	
	<P>Some women are eager to take you, and make of you what you are not,
	<BR>And others will take you the way that you are, for every last thing that you've got.
	<BR>But the one who wants simply to love you is made out of different stuff,
	<BR>And she may be one in a million, but one at a time is enough.</P>
