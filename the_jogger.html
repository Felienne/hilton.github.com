		<p>Round and round the jogger goes,
		<br>A goldfish in a bowl.
		<br>He's keeping fit, and well he knows
		<br>How sloth can take its toll.
		
		<p>He's lithe of limb, fair play, he means
		<br>To keep himself like that.
		<br>No doubt he eats up all his greens,
		<br>And shuns excessive fat.
		
		<p>But what of this poor fellow's mind
		<br>As he jogs round and round?
		<br>Does he run backwards to unwind,
		<br>And is his brain quite sound?
		
		<p>Does his imagination find
		<br>Excursions high and low,
		<br>Or is his mind at last confined
		<br>Inside one sterile O?
		
		<p>And when on leave does he run through
		<br>Great tracts of rural ground,
		<br>Or is he only able to
		<br>Run round and round and round?
