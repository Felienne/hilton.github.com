	<strong>Carmina Burana</strong>, Singerstrasse</a></ADDRESS>



<p>	Even though I was planning to look for more unfamiliar food than Italian

	cuisine, I had to come to this little restaurant just to check out the decor: the murals on the walls are fantastic. I tried to come here on Friday night but there wasn't a single empty chair. Now it's just after 9 p.m. and I have the restaurant to myself.</p>

	In Vienna it is more common to order a glass of an open wine than to get

	a whole bottle. The larger of two sizes is a <em>viertel</em> - 0.25l, which is served in one of two ways. Some places give you a tiny wine glass and a little quarter-litre jug. Here I have just been presented with the much better alternative - a quarter of a litre of wine in one huge glass. That is Much Better.</p>



<p>	Carefully avoiding the starters called 'something 

	<em>&uuml;berbacken</em>', which is usually a huge pile of food covered in cheese and baked, I picked the salmon <em>carpaccio</em>. I love smoked salmon and this tastes very good, but they don't seem to have defrosted it very evenly, so the temperature is a bit uneven.</p>



<p>	Oops - I seem to have made a mistake and ordered a large plate of 

	butter, cream and ham, lightly garnished with tortellini. I should have guessed that the <em>Tortellini Carmina Burana</em> would be so much oriented towards local tastes. I'd better try to make up for such excess tomorrow...</p>
