<p>Sometimes I walk along the wall
<br>Instead of on the ground.
<br>This change of viewpoint gives a small
<br>Pleasure as I have found.</p>

<p>Wall walking, which for any child
<br>Is part of normal play,
<br>Fifty years on, though less than wild,
<br>May still provoke dismay</p>

<p>In pale grey men who fear a thrill.
<br>Today as years ago
<br>Wall walkingâ€™s fun. I do it still.
<br>I wanted you to know!</p>
