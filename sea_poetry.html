		<p>There are wonderful verses that sing of the sea.
		<br>A lot of what's written is true.
		<br>But reading it while you sit under a tree
		<br>Will give an inaccurate view.
		
		<p>You may read of the glorious tropical moon
		<br>Reflected on gunmetal swells,
		<br>But your girl isn't there, and you see it alone,
		<br>And you're aching, but nobody tells.
		
		<p>Your watches at times are just writing the log,
		<br>And looking at sea after sea,
		<br>And then in dense traffic you run into fog,
		<br>Alert as you ever can be.
		
		<p>The power unharnessed in one living storm
		<br>Is a marvel that catches the breath.
		<br>It always excites me as long as I'm warm;
		<br>In not too much danger of death.
		
		<p>To deny the romance of the sea is unjust,
		<br>But what is "Sea Fever's" allure?
		<br>"...go down to the seas again," well if you must
		<br>You're in need of the money for sure.
		
		<p>Sea life is just life with its doldrums and gales,
		<br>Its reefs and hospitable shores.
		<br>But it's real, and not a collection of tales,
		<br>And it's mine, but the fantasy's yours.
