﻿<p>When the glass goes down, and the wind gets up,
<br>And the seas go boiling past,
<br>And it starts to howl, and the white streaked waves
<br>Rise higher than your mast,
<br>Well past the stage where Beaufort says
<br>That spindrift starts to form,
<br>You may fairly state, and beyond debate,
<br>You are witnessing a storm.</p>

<p>All the while you stand on your long dark watch,
<br>And sea follows after sea.
<br>Each answering pitch to the sea’s steep fetch
<br>Brings a power of mystery.
<br>Gone a thousand years or a month ago
<br>With those who went last tide,
<br>All the air blows live with the kindly ghosts
<br>Of the seafarers who died.</p>

<p>And these friendly souls surrounding you
<br>Prohibit all thought of fear
<br>In the face of risk and some perils too,
<br>So your mind is calm and clear.
<br>Each one of them has passed beyond
<br>That unknown one way gate,
<br>And they know the game, and they understand,
<br>And they’ll help you through your fate.</p>

<p>If your time has come, may you meet it well
<br>With the spirits gone before,
<br>But you’ll mostly live with a tale to tell
<br>That they can’t accept ashore.
<br>So when storms arise in the curdling skies,
<br>And she starts to wallop and shake,
<br>You should open your mind and your ears and your eyes,
<br>For the dead themselves are awake.</p>
