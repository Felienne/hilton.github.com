	Explanation</h3> 
 
<p>The smile so very well known 
<br>On the face of the Mona Lisa 
<br>Is there because she was shown 
<br>The plans of the Tower of Pisa. 
 
 
<a name="soaps"></a><h3>Soaps</h3> 
 
<p>You can't live in very high hopes 
<br>If you model your life on the soaps. 
<br>In the soaps they have lines. 
<br>Real people have minds, 
<br>So a real person usually copes. 
 
 
<a name="paris_is_for_lovers"></a><h3>Paris Is For Lovers</h3> 
 
<p>'Paris is for lovers,' so it's said. 
<br>Quite right, in Paris better stay in bed. 
<br>The prices are all high, the folk are mean, 
<br>And hardly any of the streets are clean. 
<br>But lovers will not see or hear or know, 
<br>They're wrapped up snug in their own rosy glow. 
 
 
<a name="one_night_stand"></a><h3>One Night Stand (Historical)</h3> 
 
<p>I'm glad that we have met tonight. 
<br>I'm happy when I see 
<br>That you're prepared to linger with 
<br>A stranger such as me. 
 
<p>We've both known troubles of our own 
<br>And each would like to see 
<br>Some proof that men and women aren't 
<br>Designed to disagree. 
 
 
<a name="personal_ad"></a><h3>Personal Ad. (Now obsolete)</h3> 
 
<p>Sea captain. 
<br>No ties. 
<br>Several shirts. 
<br>Fifty plus tax. 
<br>Free to a good home. 
<br>A better listener than your dog. 
<br>Less jealous than your cat. 
<br>A better cuddle than your teddy bear. 
<br>Probably... 
<br>The oldest toyboy in town.
