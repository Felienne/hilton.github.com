	<strong>Out and about in Antwerp</strong>. Last time I went exploring in Antwerp we started off at the Antwerp Hilton, not because I was staying there - I'm not rich enough for that - but because it's right in the middle of town. The Antwerp Hilton is big and impressive, despite having no connection with Hilton Harbour whatsoever, and has a great location dominating the main square. After being impressed by the square, but not by its cafes, we wandered down to the river, where we found a statue that seemed to be something to point at. It's got a stupid name - <em>Lange Wapper</em> - and you can find it next to the old toll-house in the background. It was a bit of a touristy day really, and it wasn't until my next visit that I got to have a drink in <em>Cafe Hoegaarden</em>.</p>
