ï»¿<p>The woman I love and the woman I hate
<br>Both came in at my garden gate.</p>

<p>The woman I love was full of cheer,
<br>Her conversation good to hear.
<br>The woman I hate could only squawk
<br>in boring microscopic talk.</p>

<p>The woman I love was calmly wise
<br>With rounded lips and ample thighs.
<br>The woman I hate had fluttery eyes
<br>And really believed she told no lies</p>

<p>The woman I love in simple dress
<br>Epitomised attractiveness.
<br>The woman I hate was only frilly.
<br>She really was extremely silly.</p>

<p>The woman I love lay down with me.
<br>She had no fear of being free.
<br>The woman I hate, she dared not give.
<br>She almost seemed afraid to live.</p>

<p>The woman I love she taught me well
<br>So much more joy than I can tell.
<br>The woman I hate is a spiritual miser.
<br>She knows how deeply I despise her.</p>

<p>The woman I love and the woman I hate
<br>Went back out of my garden gate.
<br>She left me much to dwell upon,
<br>And I shed tears because she's gone.</p>
