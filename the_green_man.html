<p>Great bonfires scare Winter in November.
<br>Green mistletoe bears berries in December.
<br><span style="margin-left:3em">The Green Man watches.</span></p>

<p>Dancers step out their Equinoctial rites.
<br>Cherry Man finds old jokes that he recites.
<br><span style="margin-left:3em">The Green Man smiles.</span></p>

<p>Though churches stand upon each ancient site
<br>No priest nor parson can deny outright
<br><span style="margin-left:3em">The Green Man’s there.</span></p>

<p>No temple, no priests adulate him now.
<br>No soil in which hypocrisy can grow.
<br><span style="margin-left:3em">The Green Man rests.</span></p>

<p>Men polishing their gods beneath the Sun
<br>Claim unique truth, can’t see those gods are one.
<br><span style="margin-left:3em">The Green Man knows.</span></p>
