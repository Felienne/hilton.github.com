<div style="width:25em">	
	<p style="font-style:italic">If all the World were paper,
	<br>And all the sea were ink,
	<br>And all the trees were bread and cheese
	<br>What should be have for drink?</p>
	<p align=right>(nursery rhyme)</p>
	
	<p>When all the World is changing,
	<br>And can't tell death from birth,
	<br>When bishops whore and crooks make law
	<br>What are my values worth?
	
	<p>Where is the satisfaction
	<br>In standing for what's right,
	<br>Where no-one cares or sees or hears
	<br>Can it be worth the fight?
	
	<p>The answer rings out clearly,
	<br>When things are all confused,
	<br>You're needed more now than before,
	<br>And that's why you're abused.
