<!-- ======================================================================== -->

		<p>A railway guard named Percy Slee
		<br>Revelled in the authority
		<br>He felt he had in his posession
		<br>Concomitant with his profession.
		<br>Officiousness was his delight,
		<br>And he was always in the right.
		<br>No matter what the circumstance
		<br>He never gave a man a chance.
		<br>If anybody disagreed
		<br>They never had a chance to plead.
		<br>He'd look them in the eye and say,
		<br>"Those are the rules, we must obey,"
		<br>Refusing always to admit
		<br>Exceptions which the rules permit
		
		<p>It happened on the eighth of May
		<br>That Percy's train was on the way
		<br>From London to Bexhill-on-Sea,
		<br>Where it was due at half past three.
		<br>So, "Tickets please," was the refrain
		<br>As Percy strutted through the train.
		<br>He checked the tickets one by one.
		<br>Sold them to people who had none,
		<br>As is the duty of the guard.
		<br>One of these last produced a card
		<br>On which it said in letters clear
		<br>"The holder need not pay full fare,
		<br>"For reason that he's handicapped."
		<br>But Percy did not deem this apt.
		<br>He said, "This only can apply
		<br>"To holders of this card who buy
		<br>"Their tickets at the railway station."
		<br>And adding to the man's vexation,
		<br>"You'll pay full fare, there's no appealing."
		<br>And stood there showing no sign of feeling.
		
		<p>Now normally this attitude,
		<br>Though barely short of being rude,
		<br>Would have provoked no more reaction
		<br>Than signs of mild dissatisfaction,
		<br>And so it seemed this very day,
		<br>Though the card holder had his say.
		<br>"But I have travelled here and there
		<br>"With this same card for half a year.
		<br>"How is it that you don't respect it?
		<br>"No one else saw fit to reject it."
		<br>But Percy with an awful smirk
		<br>Said, "Well you see I know my work.
		<br>"The terms on which you hold your card
		<br>"Are no concern of me, the guard,
		<br>"And that is written on the back
		<br>"Of that same card in simple black
		<br>"And white." The man replied,
		<br>"The words on one or other side
		<br>"Make no impression on my mind.
		<br>"I cannot read them, I am blind."
		
		<p>Alas our Percy still demurred,
		<br>Whilst all around him people stirred.
		<br>A lady sitting opposite
		<br>Said, "Well I never, what a squit."
		<br>Another said, "I quite agree,
		<br>"His wife should make him strychnine tea."
		<br>A parson, looking straight at Percy,
		<br>Said, "When you are in need of mercy
		<br>"Will you deserve it?" We shall see
		<br>He had the gift of prophecy.
		<br>Briefcase beside him on the seat,
		<br>From head to toe respendent, neat,
		<br>In pin striped suit and bowler hat,
		<br>As shiny as a butcher's cat,
		<br>There cooly sat a city gent,
		<br>A man who'd not expressed dissent
		<br>Since once in nineteen fifty-three,
		<br>When sent to bed without his tea,
		<br>Unjustly deemed a naughty child.
		<br>But now he sat with aspect mild,
		<br>Except his eyes appeared to spark
		<br>As he delivered this remark,
		<br>"What an obnoxious little man."
		
		<p>Across from him sat Animal Dan.
		<br>A nickname earned in days gone by.
		<br>It does not matter how or why.
		<br>His build was rather solid and compact,
		<br>Relaxed, but ready if called to act.
		<br>His speed and scientific art
		<br>Quelled trouble before it could start.
		<br>He very rarely got in fights,
		<br>For when he'd read a man his rights,
		<br>There'd be no more for him to say,
		<br>And once more Dan had won the day.
		<br>Apart from being extremely hard
		<br>Our Dan was really quite a card.
		<br>It happened, too, that on this day
		<br>His mood was rather one for play
		<br>Than giving anybody pain
		<br>He felt inclined to entertain.
		
		<p>So rising smartly from his seat,
		<br>He said, "Fair play, you've got us beat."
		<br>And, capturing Percy's hand, said, "Shake,
		<br>"You know your stuff and no mistake."
		<br>And he gave the hand a playful squeeze.
		<br>Percy sank screaming to his knees.
		<br>The passengers around were hushed.
		<br>They'd heard the sound. The hand was crushed.
		<br>"Oh dear," said Dan, "Your hand seems sore.
		<br>"You must have caught it in the door."
		<br>And lifting Percy off his feet
		<br>He placed him in an empty seat.
		<br>As Percy struggled, "Keep still," said he,
		<br>"You'll do yourself an injury.
		<br>"Don't move, and most of all don't laugh."
		<br>He deftly improvised a scarf
		<br>To sling the right arm safe and sound,
		<br>Then taking out some line he bound
		<br>The other arm. "Don't worry pal,
		<br>"You'll soon be safe in hospital."
		<br>By then the train was slowing down.
		<br>It stopped at a small country town
		<br>Where Dan alighted straight away,
		<br>And to a porter thus did say,
		<br>"I fear there's been a small disaster,
		<br>"You'd better tell the station master.
		<br>"The guard has injured his right hand.
		<br>"He's in some pain and cannot stand
		<br>"From shock and faintness. At a glance,
		<br>"I'd say he needs an ambulance."
		
		<p>So one was called, and Percy Slee
		<br>Was taken into casualty
		<br>At Something Hospital, Somewhere,
		<br>I really neither know nor care.
		<br>Whilst Dan departed down the lane,
		<br>And none of them saw him again.
		
		<p>The moral? There's no moral here.
		<br>I'm tired of this. Let's drink some beer.
