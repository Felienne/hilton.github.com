<p>	The richest most ambrosial gourmet meal
<br>	May lack the simple scrambled eggs appeal.
<br>	First break your eggs and put them in the pan.
<br>	Break first into a cup is the best plan.
<br>	For best results do three or four.
<br>	They tend to overcook if you do more.
<br>	Put in a dab of butter to melt through it,
<br>	The thinnest pinch of salt, don't overdo it.
<br>	For each egg, milk or water, one teaspoon.
<br>	Stir all together on the heat, and soon
<br>	As the egg sets you start to scrape and stir.
<br>	A bendy spatula's what I prefer
<br>	To do this job you may well choose
<br>	The wooden spoon your grandmother would use.
<br>	So stir and scrape and every moment look
<br>	To see the mixture doesn't overcook.
<br>	Before it sets, turn out on a cool plate.
<br>	It cooks on when you take it off the heat.
<br>	I made this once for my son when he was four.
<br>	He told me, "It's so nice I want some more."
