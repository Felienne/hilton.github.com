		<p>She seems ready and we agree,
		<br>And troubles are behind us.
		<br>We guess ahead, but cannot see,
		<br>As no one need remind us.
		
		<p>Is there enough between us two?
		<br>When our first fever ends,
		<br>And doing still as lovers do,
		<br>Will we be also friends?
		
		<p>As I have anchored for the night
		<br>In every sheltered port,
		<br>I wonder now if this is right.
		<br>Am I the constant sort?
		
		<p>We have a chance, I will agree,
		<br>But is it right toake it?
		<br>She seems ready, but will I be?
		<br>Now is no time to fake it.
