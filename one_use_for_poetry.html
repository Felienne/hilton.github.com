		<p>To please a lady you could do far worse
		<br>Than make some lavish sentimental rhyme
		<br>In simple metricated verse,
		<br>And read it to her at some tender time.
		
		<p>Flowers can seem romantic it is true,
		<br>But when you carry them along the street,
		<br>The local gossips will take note of you.
		<br>A written verse is always more discreet.
		
		<p>A jewelled bracelet or a diamond ring
		<br>May well lead on to passion or to thrills.
		<br>'There's one born every minute,' jewellers sing,
		<br>Whilst ringing up your money in their tills.
		
		<p>Do as you please, but my advice is clear,
		<br>Murmur romantic verses in her ear.
