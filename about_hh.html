<h2>What Hilton Harbour is</h2>

<p><?php Thumbnail ('ha', 'right', ''); ?>
Hilton Harbour is an <strong>eclectic collection</strong>, written by myself and people I know. My aim is to publish more content than either graphics which say almost nothing, let alone a thousand words, or just a list of <a href="links.phtml" title="my favourite web sites">links</a>, which would be nothing more than <a href="meta_content.phtml" title="prose and cons: meta-content in the media">meta-content</a>. This way, I feel better about expressing strong opinions about other poeple's web sites.</p>

<p>Hilton Harbour, to some degree, is a personal experiment in designing and implementing a web site. This is captured by my <a href="web_site_architecture.phtml">Web Site Architecture</a> guidelines and the <a href="web_page_design_principles.phtml">Web Page Design Principles</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Hilton Harbour exists</h2>

<p>Obviously, I'm hoping that each of these pages will one-day provide someone with some work-avoidance or <strong>something better to do than watch television</strong>. Perhaps less obviously, I hope that for each page in Hilton Harbour at least one person in the world will learn something new or think about a question that they have never asked themselves. Or just waste some time in <a href="european_cafe_watch.phtml">a cafe somewhere</a>.</p>

<p>I am also interested in <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/archive/1998/04/20.html">content syndication</a> and the idea of big sites <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/archive/1997/05/05.html"> mining content from independent content providers</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, I enjoy writing, playing with photos and trying to do the odd illustration.</p>

<h2>How Hilton Harbour is produced</h2>

<p>All of the HTML on these pages was coded <strong>by hand</strong> because I have yet to use a WYSIWYG Web page editor which I like. I once tried quite a few of the popular ones, and even liked a couple, but they still were not what I want. These days, I am happy using <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>As well as a text editor to code the pages, I have used a variety of validators - currently the <a href="http://www.zappatic.net/safaritidy/">Safari Tidy plugin</a>. Validation tools are essential.</p>

<p>The pages are assembled from a standard <strong>page template</strong> and a bare HTML file for the content using server-side <strong>PHP scripting</strong>.</p>

<p>I usually use an <strong>Apple Macintosh</strong> to create these pages and the images, because I much prefer using <em>Mac OS</em> to any of the variants of <em>Microsoft Windows</em> and none of the other alternatives are practicable for me. Sometimes I use <strong>Debian Linux</strong> at work. Anyway, it is not worth trying to explain why I use a Mac, although I suspect that anyone who had also used both <em>Mac OS</em> and <em>Windows</em> professionally for hundreds of hours or more each might be able to hazard a guess.</p>

<p>Also, in a recent change of heart on using graphics, I have starting using FamFamFam <a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/">Silk</a> and <a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/">Flag</p> icons.
