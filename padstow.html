<p>Padstow, known as 'Padstein' to some restaurant-goers, is the canonical
North Cornwall fishing port. Like Honfleur, a posh version of the same thing in Normandy, Padstow now seems to be wholly dependent on tourism. Indeed, the pretty wooden fishing boats seem more intent on catching tourists than anything at scaley.</p>

<h2>Tourist information</h2>

<p>This tourist-focus is no bad thing if you have just arrived in town, 
late in the afternoon, and you need to find an affordable bed &amp; breakfast. Naturally enough, the Padstow Tourist Information Centre is very efficient and has a whizzy new computer-based B&amp;B booking system, with photos and directions and everything. Indeed, they found us a B&amp;B with a double room for Â£16 each per night straight away.</p>

<h2>Bed &amp; breakfast</h2>

<p>The B&amp;B (1 Casworth Terrace, tel. 01841 532025) turned out to be
clean, close and comfy, but slightly odd. The ideal B&amp;B makes it feel as if you are staying at your grandmother's place; here is was more like staying at someone else's. Maybe it was just the lace doylies all over the place, and the lace outer shower curtain.</p>

<h2>Fish &amp; chips</h2>

<p>Down on the quay, Walkers harbourside cafe seems to the best place to
sample the local fish and chips and have a cup of tea. Unfortunately, we were too late in the evening for fish and chips, but the tea was really strong and served in proper mugs - just the thing.</p>

<h2>Seafood</h2>

<p>Actually, missing out on the fish and chips was no bad thing because we 
ended up having a gorgeous meal at the Golden Lion pub, opposite the Cindrome on Lanadwell street - my scallop bake was fantastic. The Golden Lion is one of those cosy traditional pubs whose decor is very dark wood and plain white walls, like an inside-out pint of Guinness. You find these pubs all over the British Isles and they are invariably good friendly places.</p>

<h2>Proper pub</h2>

<p>Later on we went for a drink in the warm, comfy and seedy Harbour Inn, 
around the other side if the harbour. This is a real seaman's pub, with tasteless decor, old memorabilia, dodgy coloured lighting and cheap tables, as if they need to be replaced every now and then. The Harbour Inn was perfectly friendly to us, if a bit quiet, and there were no seamen to be seen. The best of the clutter, apart from the lump of wood with a ship's name that forms the mantlepiece, is the collection of sailors' hat ribbons, or whatever they are called.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I am just writing to comment on your piece of writing about Padstow. Although i have nothing against Rick Stein people very much disaprove of Padstow being refered to as Padstein.</p>
<p>1 Casworth Terrace, you make out to be as fake and unfreindly whereas Ann is a wonderfully freindly women and does her best for anyone who stays, as my cousins nana her house is the way she likes it as everyones is and just like staying in your grans house.</p>
<p>I also have many family members who own 'pretty wooden fishing boats' and fishing is a main industry in Padstow to the Padstow people. We have a supermarket and factory which employs many people in the town and anyway you make it out as if relying on tourists for work is a bad thing. I am sure you didnt mean to but many people in Padstow would be fused to read this.</p>

<p>The search engine found your piece on Padstow. I'm glad you found the Golden Lion, now ahead of the London Inn in popularity but the beer's not cheap.</p>
<p>On the whole you seem to have got a grasp of the place. Next time take a look at the lesser restaurants in the town catering to those who come here and find they can't get a table at Stein's. Come again.</p>
