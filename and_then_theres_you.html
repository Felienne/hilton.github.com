<p>As a child he was mothered,
<br>Played, learned persistence,
<br>Misbehaved, was the curse
<br>And blessing of his Ma’s existence.</p>

<p>Was taught good morals
<br>To let alone the theivable,
<br>And given a religion
<br>To believe the unbelievable.</p>

<p>Went to school – or not,
<br>Was his parents’ pride and anxiety.
<br>Puberty fact, girls theory,
<br>The frustration of propriety.</p>

<p>Married and had children,
<br>In that order perhaps.
<br>Worked to keep his family
<br>As well as other chaps.</p>

<p>Picture him if you can
<br>Before your inner eyes.
<br>So like yourself this man,
<br>That it could be a surprise</p>

<p>To find he’s a Lapp or a Maori,
<br>An Inuit or a Jew,
<br>Anybody from Arab to Zulu,
<br>And then there’s you.</p>
