<p>A good cafe is a comfortable place to sit around for hours on end and
chat to 
<a href="http://www3.mistral.co.uk/whitedot/htdocs/comm1.htm">friends</a>, just like your lounge at home but with a better selection of coffee and of people. So a cafe needs a sofa for the same reason that your lounge does. The real question, then, is why a cafe should be like your lounge.</p>

<h2>What cafes are for</h2>

<p><a href='photos_cafes_inside.phtml'><img src='picture/photo/england/disco_biscuit_upstairs_s.jpeg' width='180' height='198' alt='sofas upstairs in Disco Biscuit, Queens Road, Brighton, England' title='sofas upstairs in Disco Biscuit, Queens Road, Brighton, England' style='float:right'></a>
As far as I am concerned, cafes are different from pubs, bars,
restaurants and nightclubs because those are places that you go to when you want to go out to eat, for a drink or to dance. A cafe is where you go to meet up with people when that's not what you fancy, especially when you just want to sit around idly all afternoon.</p>

<p>Some cafes think that their <em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em> is good coffee. 
Coffee is certainly an important part of sitting around drinking coffee (and every cafe should have good coffee) but it is not the most important part.</p>


<h2>Why sofas need books</h2>

<p>Like your lounge, a good cafe is multi-purpose - if you're not going to
sit around and chat then you might want a book to read. This is why lots of people have a 
<a href="http://public.logicacmg.com/~stepneys/bib/unread.htm">bookcase</a> in their lounge.</p>

Fortunately, quite a few book shops, such as 
<a href="http://www.borders.co.uk/">Borders</a>, have caught on. There is even the odd cafe that has caught on and installed book shelves. <a href="http://www.cb1.com/">CB1</a>, on Mill Road in Cambridge, is my favourite example.</p>


<h2>Why good cafes are not like your lounge</h2>

<p>Good cafes are not completely like your lounge, because your lounge
probably has a television in it. The cafes are right and you are wrong - you would be better off throwing the television away.
