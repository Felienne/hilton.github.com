<p>There were two or three inches of snow on the ground and a keen east
wind as we approached the hamlet.</p>
<p>The old and derelict stone inn we had an &lsquo;order to view&rsquo;
seemed devoid of life. On closer inspection however this idea was
shattered by the noisy greetings of  some ten or so spaniel type dogs
of varying ages.</p>
<p>The long low herring bone stone building with odd spiral glass
windows boasted a central door over which was the inscription, &lsquo;Miss
Baxendale. Licenced to sell Beers, Wines, Spirits &amp; Tobacco.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We knocked. After several minutes the rickety door was opened by a
middle aged female. Her attire was in keeping with the derelict
nature of the house as if to match. One leg was patched up with an
untidy bandage kept in position by a wrinkled stocking.</p>
<p>We were ushered into a stone flagged living room. On a small oak
table with a newspaper serving as a cloth were the remains of a meal
which appeared to have consisted largely of a loaf of bread. A fire
burned brightly in a modern grate and in the hearth was a blackened
saucepan containing a very dubious mess.</p>
<p>The remainder of the furnishings consisted of a much worn carpet and
Victorian furniture, a settee and two chairs, from all of which
stuffing and springs protruded. On every chair there seemed to be a
dog and the pervading smell was of frowsty dirty dog. 
</p>
<p>Before we were asked to sit down a newspaper was hurriedly produced
for each of us, a dog pushed from its seat and the newspaper put in
its place.</p>
<p>The building consisted of two rooms, each serving as a bar, a tiny
office room at one end, and over the top, being the first floor, two
attics, one with a skylight and the other with a window on the floor
level. Attached precariously to the rear was a corrugated iron roofed
structure which served as a kitchen. This boasted the only tap in the
house, an ancient sink and a dilapidated oil stove. Up the garden was
a privy containing a rusty elsan closet.</p>
<p>Such was the Board Inn when Pamela and I bought it and took up
residence in April, 1946.</p>
<p>Our plan which seemed ambitious then (and often afterwards) was to
convert it into a comfortable country inn. In those days we knew
nothing of building, of licences, of Town &amp; Country Planning (as
it was), of justices&rsquo; requirements etcetera. We had a little
money and great faith.</p>
<p>The hamlet, &lsquo;Newholm&rsquo; by name, was some two miles from
the old sea port and seaside resort of Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.
It consisted of some thirty cottages, a Methodist chapel, a telephone
booth and no shops. Water was &lsquo;&hellip; by gravitation&rsquo;
according to the agent, but by chance or luck would have been a more
accurate description. Sanitation consisted of an unfinished and
sometimes open sewer which served most of the village and apparently
ended in someone&rsquo;s ornamental lake. No one had thought it
necessary to fit a drain trap to our only drain hole in the kitchen.
Consequently when the wind was in the right quarter we knew all about
it.</p>
<p>Our first ally was Syd (<I>Easton</I>), a neighbour. He combined the
trades of cobbler, butcher, builder, planner, barman and adviser in
chief. Never could there have been greater loyalty and more common
sense and skill in one body. When he first introduced himself to us
he was in a butcher&rsquo;s apron delivering the meat. Immediately he
heard our plans his enthusiasm and building instincts were kindled.
At the moment he was employed, but he could put us onto a good man
who would do all we asked. And he did.</p>
<p>Tom (<I>Waller</I>) started on our payroll about a week later. His
hours were never really defined. We never knew his age, but when he
came he seemed retired and still a bachelor. A kinder and more
conscientious worker could not be found in a month of Sundays. He
lived for work and usually had to be told to stop.</p>
<p>To begin our work it was necessary to excavate an area 62ft by 15 ft
(18.6m X 4.5m) to a depth of 8ft (2.4m) at one end. Mostly solid
clay. This with the aid of a horse and cart he did mostly on his own
- about six weeks.</p>

<p style="text-align:right;font-style:italic">(Written by my father, C.F.R. Hilton, 1904 - 1980)</p>

<p>The conveyancing when the inn was bought was done by one Richard
Crawford, who undertook such work without having any legal
qualification. He operated from the front room of his house in
Scarborough, which was designated the &lsquo;estates department.&rsquo;
When my father arrived there Richard was seated at a table typing
with one finger. He wore a green eye shade and a brown apron with
pens and pencils in the front pocket. When business was concluded and
the document signed he rang a bell and his wife brought in a tray of
tea. The document still exists in a frame and a copy, typographical
errors and all, follows.</p>

<p>So at the age of six I came with my parents to the North Riding of
Yorkshire, where a stone is a &lsquo;stee-an,&rsquo; blank dominoes
are &lsquo;blonks&rsquo; and you live in &lsquo;oose&rsquo; the
article being usually left out. &lsquo;Newholm&rsquo; is pronounced
&lsquo;Newum&rsquo; or it was then. Naturally I acquired all this
within about a fortnight, to the delight of the locals who commented
on my departure from my mother tongue with,&rsquo;Talkin&rsquo;
Yorkshire? Tha&rsquo;ll get thy tongue tied in a knot!&rsquo; Years
later when my ship was in Whitby I went to have a look at Newholm.
The taxi driver pronounced all the letters, but I put this down to
Whitby folk feigning literacy.</p>
<p>When my grandmother, the family&rsquo;s social climber visited she
was appalled and also quite scandalised to be addressed as &lsquo;Grandma.&rsquo;
She tried to cajole and bribe me into reverting to BBC speech, but I
seem to remember that I only used this on people I wasn&rsquo;t
talking to. I must have been an appalling child.</p>
<p>I know nothing of the viewing visit to the Board Inn, but in April it
and the previous owner were just as my father described, although the
bandage may have been discarded. What I do remember was the
fascinating experience of living in a house undergoing refurbishment.
After &lsquo;Owd Tom&rsquo; had excavated sufficiently (and removed
the decayed remains of some of Miss Baxendale&rsquo;s past dogs) the
brick walled, corrugated roofed kitchen was easily demolished (as
local clay had been used for mortar), foundations were set and
building began. Local sandstone from a burnt out mill was used and
&lsquo;Owd Tom&rsquo; did most of this work too. His large tea mug
was replenished at suitable intervals and I remember his face mostly
disappearing into it while his ears stood out a good way on either
side. 
</p>
<p>The stone from the mill matched the existing building well enough
even though each stone had a slight curve to it. This was fortuitous
later as the awaited planning application had been held up for
months. 
</p>
<p>Town &amp; Country Planning officials heard that some unapproved
building was going on and came to inspect. Looking at the new wall
with Syd&lsquo;s or Tom&rsquo;s special old looking mortar one of
them said, &lsquo;This wall needs pointing up. Hardly surprising, it
must have been here for hundreds of years.&rsquo; My father asked,
&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it difficult to get a permit?&rsquo; &lsquo;Never
mind that,&rsquo; was the reply, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll see to it.&rsquo;
And they did.</p>
<p>Syd was certainly very handy. I often watched him work at various
projects. To this day I can see him fitting the brace to one of the
garage doors and I now realise that many of the things I now know how
to do were developed from practising what I saw Syd do years ago. Not
without help from others. Syd may not have been quite the angel my
father makes him out to be. He certainly knew how to look after his
own interests and was ready to take credit for others achievements as
will be seen later. However he used his deceitful skills to our
advantage more than once and I cannot accuse him of more than
enlightened self interest.</p>
<p>Syd was a slender man, but his wife, Vera, was of generous
proportions.  It was occasionally suggested that he was lucky to have
one who would keep him warm of winter nights. He always explained
that she was so fat that she lifted the bedclothes off him so that
the cold wind blew around him.  
</p>
<p>One day when my father was particularly busy with pub business two
officials came to see our chickens. We kept them for the eggs which
were strictly rationed at the time and much needed for pub food. Syd
was asked to conduct these two individuals to the chicken run a
couple of hundred yards away. Two or three hours later all three
returned, the officials looking exhausted and mud splattered, but
saying all was in order. After they left my father asked Syd what had
happened. Syd explained that there was a difficulty with the number
of chickens. We were only supposed to have two dozen and the same
number of day old chicks had just been delivered putting us well over
strength. Day olds still counted as chickens. Syd had shown the men
his own chickens about sixteen in number, but free range and about
half a mile away. Syd had had an enjoyable time &lsquo;helping&rsquo;
them count the chickens by chasing them in and out of hedges. One up
for the countryman and more fool anyone who thinks of him as a yokel.
 
</p>
<p>At that time there was no electricity supply to the village. Oil
lamps were used. My father located a Hornsby Ruston petrol-paraffin
engine of considerable age, a dynamo and a large number of nife
batteries. These batteries can be charged and discharged time after
time without damage. They were much more bulky than lead-acid
batteries. No good for a car, but that was no problem for a static
generating plant. The engine itself had a single horizontal cylinder
and a large flywheel. It produced 24 volt electricity. When lights
were switched on in the evening they were often found to be rather
dim as the batteries had been run down the night before, the gradual
decrease merely adding to the atmosphere. The generator would then be
started and there was light as miraculous as in Genesis. I remember
the accompanying solid thump-thump-thump from the shed in the back
garden as a most reassuring sound Akin to the sound of a mother busy
preparing a meal in the kitchen. Later the village institute, an
asbestos building next door, was also given electric light. I think
they got it free. My father was a qualified electrician although he
never did it as a job. 
</p>
<p>Years later an article appeared in the Caterer &amp; Hotel Keeper
magazine telling how electricity had been installed in a Yorkshire
pub. Syd was the man who had done it and took the credit. I don&rsquo;t
think any of us minded. He was entitled to any credit that was going.
And he wouldn&rsquo;t have had to tell any lies. He had cast the
concrete block the engine stood on and had supervised the bedding
down of the engine. However electricity scared him.</p>
<p>The extension at the back of the house ran the full length of the
building and afforded space for more than just a kitchen. In the
early stages of construction, before the roof went on, a second hand
railway tarpaulin was used to keep the weather out. Clearly it had
been much handled when folded up and holes had been worn at several
of the folds. I remember buckets and basins being placed under the
leaks during rainy weather.</p>
<p>The completion of the building included a restaurant with a small but
picturesque cocktail bar rigged out to look like the back of a
covered wagon. Also there were panelled alcoves for more intimate
diners. A stone fireplace was included and my father remarked to a
regular customer that the mantelpiece would have to be made of
several stones, no single stone of the required length being
obtainable. At dead of night the man and his brother returned with a
long stone with earth on one end and green lichen on the other.
Obviously a scratching post from a nearby field and presumably from
the brothers&rsquo; farm.</p>
<p>The joiner at the nearby village of Aislaby laid a fine tongued and
grooved floor and made an excellent oak refectory table in
traditional style. This had the corners rubbed off and the foot rail
worn away so that as the wood darkened with age it would begin to
look antique. If it still exists it probably passes for twice its
present age.</p>
<p>Newholm also had a joiner. He was a kindly old gentleman. When my toy
cart needed attention the village children advised me that he would
mend it and he was happy to do so. Syd, who built the cart, must have
been elsewhere. In December the joiner came to the inn seeking
provisions for Christmas. He said he thought rum was good for keeping
out the cold and asked whether my father could suggest anything else.
&lsquo;Some people prefer whisky,&rsquo; said my father. &lsquo;A
bottle, then,&rsquo; said the joiner. &lsquo;Ladies sometimes prefer
gin.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh well, I&rsquo;ll have a bottle of that too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My father had caught the drift and said, &lsquo;What about wine?&rsquo;
The joiner said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about that. What have
you got?&rsquo; &lsquo;Red or white.&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have
one of each.&rsquo; And so it went on, the joiner ordering a bottle
of every drink in stock until there was too much for him to carry
home. My father offered to deliver it, but the joiner refused. He
said, &lsquo;Ah&rsquo;ll lerrit get about that I&rsquo;m doing some
work for you and fetch it bit by bit in my tool bag. And this he did
- merry Christmas!</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just the severity of that Winter that caused
problems. It was very late and put back all the planting and seeding
so that the harvest was very poor. I remember seeing scabs of snow on
North slopes and in sheltered places in May that year.</p>
<p>With the addition of the restaurant there was much more work to do.
Mrs. Scales, a war widow, came in to clean. She had two sons, Colin
and Dennis. Dennis was my age and Colin a year or so older. We used
to roam all over the countryside with Syd&rsquo;s son Alan and our
golden labrador bitch, Sue, who went everywhere with me. 
</p>
<p>Mary Parker presided in the kitchen, or at least supported my mother.
And then there was Kathleen.</p>
<p>My grandfather came from a family where servants were the norm and my
grandmother aspired to this. Therefore, once my grandfather&rsquo;s
stage career blossomed, one was engaged. This was Kathleen. However,
by the time we took the Board Inn my grandparents had moved into a
flat and had no need of her. So she came to us ready and well able to
undertake any domestic task, including looking after me whenever I
could be caught. I imagine she would have been middle aged by then,
but that may be a mistaken impression. She certainly seemed an old
maid to me, but with a twinkle.</p>
<p>Waiting at table in the restaurant was a duty Kathleen took on as
though born to it. In those days of rationing most people knew little
of gastronomy. There simply wasn&rsquo;t much choice of foods from
which to learn. Kathleen would reel off a list of cheeses (or perhaps
it was on the menu) and people would look blank. She would help out
by asking, &lsquo;Do you want smelly cheese or ordinary cheese.&rsquo;
In due course the cheeses appeared on the menu under the headings
&lsquo;Smelly&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ordinary.&rsquo; Is this the first
example of an educational menu?</p>
<p>My bedroom was in the attic with the skylight and a dormer window had
been added. It was adequate for me, but I remember my father hitting
his head on a cross beam. He was well able to take it and I am
fortunate to have inherited the same kind of robust cranium.</p>
<p>I would go to sleep most nights to the sound of revelry from below.
Current popular songs included such mindless numbers as &lsquo;Maresy
Doats and Dozey Doats&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chickory Chick.&rsquo; If you
can&rsquo;t remember them you are lucky. But the records played
downstairs were of real songs. I remember &lsquo;Pedro the Fisherman&rsquo;
and &lsquo;La Bella Margarita.&rsquo; The latter sung by a light
tenor with a Mediterranean accent and presumably filling some with
nostalgic memories of wartime operations in Italy where <I>signorinas
</I>showed themselves grateful to be liberated, or the other way
round.     
</p>
<p>The Board Inn became a popular country inn just as my father had
planned. The public bar with its flagged floor (or was it concrete?)
suited the locals in their wellies. Meanwhile the saloon bar was
refurbished with beams from old houses that were being demolished in
Whitby&rsquo;s Baxtergate. Some of these were originally ship&rsquo;s
spars and still had sheaves for the running rigging to pass through.
A carpet was added and the effect was of old world comfort. 
</p>
<p>This ideal state of affairs naturally had its drawbacks. A pub is
open seven days a week and suitable people to relieve hard to find. I
believe my parents tried at least once, but trial and error is the
only way. I think they never made a trial that did not end in error.
Also they held private parties after hours which produced the sounds
of revelry that lulled me so pleasantly to sleep while my parents
overworked. Another consideration may have been that I was left to
run wild more than was considered good for me. The remedy was to sell
up, but this was in the future. 
</p>
<p>Childhood memories are supposed to be of everlasting Summer, but I
think the Winter of 1947 must be remembered by all who experienced
it. There were very heavy falls of snow. Barker Lane between Whitby
and Newholm was filled up level from hedge top to hedge top on either
side. Newholm was cut off as were many communities in the Dales and
much more seriously. Many villages in the dales were cut off for a
long period and animals on the moors starved and froze to death.
Farmers made good use of horse drawn sledges, large boards on steel
shod runners.</p>
<p>Of course I was not aware of all the consequences of all this. All I
was aware of was deep snowdrifts that you could jump into without
getting hurt or even properly dirty. It was cold and smaller children
howled when the frost nipped their ears and noses. It was not so much
the severity of that Winter as its lateness. Seeding and planting
were delayed and crop yields were very low. I remember even in May
there were still scabs of snow on North facing slopes and in
sheltered places.</p>
<p>On a visit from London my grandfather showed me how to dig up
pignuts. I passed this knowledge on to the local children and in
return they introduced me to &lsquo;sweet briar&rsquo; which is
obtained by peeling the tender shoots of the wild rose. It was whilst
doing this that we became aware of Kathleen walking by arm in arm
with a man well into middle age. A girl asked me, &lsquo;Is he her
young man?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Ah doant knoa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So it was that Kathleen&rsquo;s marriage forestalled the question of
her redundancy when the pub was sold. I never knew his name, but he
was a barber who had regular work cutting soldiers&rsquo; hair at
Catterick camp.</p>
