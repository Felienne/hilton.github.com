	When you get back from the <strong>pub</strong>, sometimes even a 
	<a href="rrrr.html" title="my recipes page">Rough & Ready Rapid Recipe</a> 
	is too much effort. So <strong>when you've got the beer munchies</strong> . . .


<h2>The Munchies</h2>


<h3>Fish-Finger Sandwich</h3>
	
<p>You need: bread, fish-fingers, lettuce (a concession to healthy living).</p>
	
<ol>
	<li>Microwave a few fish fingers for a few minutes.</li>
	<li>Cut a couple of slices/doorsteps of fresh bread.</li>
	<li>Arrange the bread, fish-fingers and lettuce sandwich-fashion.</li>
</ol>

Note: if you don't use a microwave the fish fingers won't be moist enough.</p>

	
<h3>Cinnamon Toasted Cheese Sandwiches</h3>
	
<p>You need: sliced bread, cheese, ground cinnamon.</p>
	
<ol>
	<li>Make two rounds of cheese sandwiches.</li>
	<li>Sprinkle some cinnamon inside.</li>
	<li>Put the sandwiches in your 'thick-slice' toaster.</li>		
</ol>
	
<p>Note: a small amount of cayenne pepper is a good cinnamon alternative.</p>


<h3>Tandoori Bacon Sandwich</h3>
	
<p><a href='picture/photo/ireland/dublin_street.jpeg'><img src='picture/photo/ireland/dublin_street_s.jpeg' width='125' height='198' alt='Dublin on a Saturday morning - everyone is still in bed!' title='Dublin on a Saturday morning - everyone is still in bed!' style='float:right'></a>
You need: bacon, bread, Sharwood's Tandoori spice marinade or Tandoori Masala.
	
<ol>
	<li>Put some bacon, in small bits, in a frying pan.</li>
	<li>Cut a couple of slices/doorsteps of fresh bread.</li>
	<li>When the bacon is wet, add some of the spice powder.</li>
	<li>Put the bread in the toaster (optional).</li>		
	<li>Stir the bacon for a bit, and then make a (toasted) sandwich with it.</li>	</ol>
	
<p>If you don't like <strong>spicy food</strong> then Garam Masala is probably a better bet than the Tandoori stuff.
